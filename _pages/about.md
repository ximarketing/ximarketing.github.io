I am Xi Li, Professor of Marketing at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). My recent research focuses on the economic analysis of algorithms. I use economics and machine learning methods to understand how information technologies such as artificial intelligence, recommender systems, data-driven algorithms, crypotology, and algorithmic pricing affect firms, consumers and the society. I am also interested in consumer protection in the digital age.
