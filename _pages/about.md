I am Xi Li, an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the City University of Hong Kong. My recent research focuses on the economic analysis of algorithms. I use economics and machine learning methods to understand how information technologies such as artificial intelligence, recommender systems, data-driven algorithms, blockchain, and algorithmic pricing affect firms, consumers and the society, and how policymakers should regulate big data and protect consumer privacy.
