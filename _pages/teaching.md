Currently, I am teaching the following classes:

**Digital Marketing** (Undergraduate)

This course takes a quantitative perspective to understand the operations of digital marketing. In addition to covering conventional topics such as search engine optimization, display advertising and social networks, the course also emphasizes on programming and data analytics. 

**Algorithms, Big Data and Online Marketplaces** (Masters)
