67	67	"After filling out a 3 page questionnaire of about 14 standard, sensible personal questions my payment was processed and my delivery received within 30 or so hours. More efficient than any GP ive had since probably the 80s and miles ahead for customer care, consideration and just human decency when compared to Superdrug! Superdrug online inhaler systems is run by complete mongrel dogs. When i was desperate for an inhaler to be delivered to work Superdrug said i passed the online consultation, took payment that evening and game me a guaranteed 12 midday next day delivery. At 11-35 day of delivery i received an email from Superdrug saying the branch manager would not dispatch my inhaler she void my online consultation. That was it? Oh and had to wait 10 days for refund. No concern at all that i had 1 option to get an inhaler at such short notice, clog up A and E at Whipps Cross hospital for 3 wasted hours as an emergency patient!! Thats why degenerates and paedos  who still wear Kourous go Superdrug so i blame myself, never again!! Medical Specialist all the way and hopefully you can push some sense down the medical hierarchy throats and suggest taking asthma inhalers completeley off the NHS burden altogether and registered asthmatics can buy when and as they need through Medical Specialist for a set price. No one should be getting inhalers through NHS anymore, type 2 diabetics have to pay ?100 a month for their insuline patch system and they do. Asthmatics should have to pay for their medication likewise and maybe this collective fair use of medicative reponsibility will help all the hands on deck within our NHS hospitals finally receive their just dues!! No more 80 hour week nurses being paid ?19,000 a year before tax, clearing 15 grand afterwards when London rents are now a standard 12 grand of that taken away for a necessity like a roof over their heads. Top it off with privatising NHS car parks with another crooked business partnership known as Euro Car Parks who provide free parking to doctors but not nursing staff,  another ?10 a day from nurses pockets? Those nurses who deliver your new born babies into the world safely, those nurses who wipe drool and bath your incontinent 80/90 year old forgotten ancestors. NHS as a service, a system to mend our broken bodies from time to time, and Medical Specialist  as a business, an exclusive partnership fair trade business supplying the whole countrys pharmaceutical needs for a price both fair and affordable to all!! What an NHS treatment service we could have? And what an unbelievable business Medical Specialist could potentially be?"
68	68	"Prompt, reliable and accurate service.  Job done. Thank you."

70	70	Easy to navigate website and simple end to end process.I would recommend this service to anyone.

201	201	I'd have given 5 stars but I was disappointed to find that the standard redelivery costs ?10 .  No justification could be given for this inflated price . Otherwise good service and fast postage .Following the reply The question I asked is why your costs to post a second time are 40% higher than the 1st time  given that you only rebag and don't rebox.  I feel the reason why it needed to be resent is totally irrelevant . I was posting a review of your service and think it's entirely fair to point out to customers that if the item is not delivered regardless of the reason they will be stung with a ?10 charge for redelivery . I was offered it at ?5 after trying to pay ?10 for another delivery and failing because your website went into meltdown and wouldn't let me do it !I failed to mention the discount as the young man who agreed it sounded worried about doing it having previously said I'd have to speak to the managing director about charges. What a lark ! Update I won't be using again

I found them to be..""politely rude"". My concerns were effectively dismissed.Not recommended."

312	312	All good. Product (Lumgen) was genuine. Fast postage
313	313	Great service but very expensive.
314	314	"This company sells in the UK, amongst other things medication for erectile dysfunction (ED), including Viagra (Silendafil) and Cialis (Tadalafil). These are 'prescription only' medications so can only be prescribed by a Doctor of Medicine in the UK.However, they offer a private prescription via an online assessment.My advice is if you need this kind of medication is to have it prescribed by a Consultant Urologist or your GP via the NHS. Men with MS or Type 2 Diabetes qualify for four tablets per month.Do not buy it from US and Canadian companies who offer these products at extortionate prices online but may have been manufactured in countries like China and India and may not have the ingredients which the licensed products have."
315	315	"Very good online Pharmacy, very professional and excellent speedy customer Service.  happy to recommend."

370	370	Been dealing with Medical Specialists for some time now and each visit is completely hassle free.
371	371	Amazing service. Fast and efficient. Very easy to use and will definitely be back!
372	372	Been with them for almost 10 years now. Very good service.
373	373	Quick and easy.
374	374	"Very good service, seemed very genuine checking that what is being ordered is correct. I would use again"
375	375	I have never had goods from you what I have had is unsolicited emails from you regarding a purchase that is actually ment for another customer. I have contacted you and informed you about the emails. Very poor management of you customers security
376	376	Excellent service . I would recommend this company to friends and family.
377	377	Helped me get required medicine when away from home
378	378	"I was a bit dubious of the company at first, but the items I ordered arrived the next day. Don't be put off by the website, I will buy from again."
379	379	"Easy to use, really quick delivery, suitable medical questions to ensure fit for purpose. Would recommend"
380	380	My experience of this company is that it provides quality medicines at reasonable prices but only after a very comprehensive questionnaire has been submitted and then only after the contents have been vetted by medical staff. In fact not much different to having an appointment with your own GP. I use them to obtain diclofenac because my GP will not prescribe a medication that really works for me but prefers to subscribe another medicine which does nothing  to help me but is probably cheaper.
381	381	Quick efficient professional  service would recommend.
382	382	"Good information about products, easy to use form to fill in. Order taken and arrived next day. Good service."
383	383	Got what I wanted no problem. Arrived the following day.
384	384	I had a problem with my card the the staff at medical specialists dealt with it very efficiently and my parcel was sent almost immediately and arrived very quickly. I would use again and recommend

398	398	This site is an absolute godsend especially when you can't get in to your dentist or doctors and your local walk in centre do not prescribe for dental abscess even though your face is swollen and you are in unbelievable pain. Would recommend to everyone and thank you so much for your help and professionalism
399	399	"Very useful service, especially when the doctors / dentist is closed!"

406	406	Very good service  super fast delivery  can not full the service
407	407	Fantastic service .Through and Prompt.
408	408	Very good service and prompt delivery
409	409	Love the convenience of being able to order my medication online without the hassle of getting a prescription and the process and delivery once the medication has been ordered is fast and efficient. However I used to be able to go into my account and reorder previous medication without the hassle of having to go through the entire process again which was preferable. I find the steps to order medication slightly confusing and the tabs that I need to press to order equipment unclear as they meld in with the rest of the page.

420	420	"I was a bit dubious about ordering prescription medicine online but this site was brilliant. They asked all the relevant questions and then kept me informed every step of the order journey, up until dispatch (and even then included a tracking number). They also included a letter for my GP in with my medication, which I found to be very professional. I couldn't be happier with the service I received here!"
421	421	Great fast service
422	422	"Very impressed with Medical Specialists, detailed consultation. Keep you informed of progress of your order. Quick to contact you if concerns, also you have the opportunity to talk to doctors."

434	434	Fabulous first class customer service.
435	435	Excellent service.  They even called me when I ordered the wrong kind of antibiotics.  They were delivered the next morning.  Can't recommend this service highly enough. They deserve the 5 star rating.

It was well packaged- and also, reassuringly, a signature was taken on delivery."

My order was placed on a weekend, the only negative things I would say is that for this type of service you'd expect it to operate over the weekend too.

So when it comes to medication for my acne, which I've used before, I trust Medicial Specialist for my medication.

782	782	"So this email lands in my inbox, please review. I havnt purchased anything from this company in at least a few years. Its not that i mind the request its just that it came bearing details that i did not share with trust pilot. I did not give medical specialists permission to share my email or any other details with trust pilot. This is the kind of big brother cyber snooping that everybody could do without. I dont really care about medical specialists either way and would not even have wqritten this if it had not been for the breach of trust. Trust pilot is implicated here aswell. Now i have to wonder if medical specialists is the reason my inbox fills with spam."

Then I discovered medical specialists online while surfing the internet. I called medical specialist by phone and they were very helpful with filling out my application, and were understanding, kind, and efficient.

841	841	"Been dealing with TOC for years and they've always been prompt and professional.  Also, perhaps reassuringly, they've declined to provide medication if they didn't think it was appropriate. So they're clearly not some dodgy internet drug supply source.  Not cheap to be honest but I think you get what you pay for."
842	842	Good service. Thanks.
843	843	Good quick delivery
844	844	"The service was prompt and professional, I answered a series of relevant questions and then a GP contacted me for more information which reassured me that my symptoms had been acknowledged and scrutinised. I received the antibiotics on time with clear instructions on how to use them.I just wish I had been told that I would need to sign fof them before I submitted my address as I would have had them delivered to work but that was a minor issue. Would definitely use again."
845	845	Great service and also really good consultation. Will use again.
846	846	Very fast delivery and well packaged/kept cold. Early days with the drug but can definitely feel I am less interested in food after just a couple of days on Saxenda.  My late night binges have just stopped.  No side effects evident although I am in the lowest dose at the moment.  I had never injected myself before but this is easy.  No pain as the needle is so tiny and short it cant really go anywhere it shouldnt.  I recommend this firm and felt the checks were thorough before allowing me to be prescribed it.
847	847	"Thorough online examination for the issue , certainly very diligent before prescribing medicine and advice very concise."

864	864	"Whilst I was a little wary at first, The Online Clinic has proved to be very conscientious in their deliberations. The blood test was easy to perform at home and I was amazed when I received the results only the next day after posting my samples.  Once cleared my prescription arrived as promised the day after ordering.  All in all very efficient and professional."
865	865	"I couldn't get an appointment at my GP for over three weeks. I had a nasty sinus infection that needed treatment. I found the Online Clinic through google. I answered questions about myself, my health and current medication. I explained what I thought was wrong with me. Within 5 minutes I had a message back from a doctor asking some more questions. Another 5 minutes later I had been issued with a prescription. The tablets were delivered to my home by DPD the next day ! Cost ? ?12. Amazing service, this is a game changer."

881	881	"I had a dental issue (abscess) and couldn??t get a dentist appointment until the following week. I don??t even bother with the doctor or else I??d have been waiting weeks!! My face was swollen and I was in a lot of pain. The Online Clinic helped me in my hour of need! I entered details of the issue online and a doctor replied very quickly to ask a few questions. They even wanted a picture of the swelling. I was prescribed antibiotics which arrived very quickly. The infection was gone by the time I visited my dentist, allowing them to see what the issue was (broken tooth) and fix it.

889	889	"Dear JaneSo, just to give you an update. I have just today, seen my usual Dr, a real Doctor, who did a medical exam & did agree that I needed antibiotics for a blocked salivary gland. He agreed that I see the surgeon but felt that was a bit extreme sending me to one.On the subject of my review, I would rather you didn't imply it was a fake review, I don't feel the need to print my personal details online for all to see thank you very much.You obviously thought I was just a numpty fishing for medication, like I have the time to waste doing that. To conclude, you got it wrong. I do have an infection. So maybe, before judging me, look at your decision making. Sepsis kills, didn't you know that? My mum had it 3 times before she died of it. If I could give you 0 stars I would. The 1 star is because I have to."
890	890	Excellent service
891	891	"Excellent service, always prompt with responses and customer services second to none"
892	892	Quick service very good Thank you
893	893	"I found The Online Clinic while searching for a cure for a fingernail infection.  The on-line consultant reviewed my case and was able to suggest a suitable remedy, very efficiently and with just a few questions.  Ordering the pills on-line was simplicity itself and they were delivered by Royal Mail the next day.  I shall certainly consider using The Online Clinic again.  It beats struggling to get a GP appointment and then waiting for ages to be seen!"

901	901	Quick and easy with prompt delivery.
902	902	Excellent service and a prompt delivery.
903	903	The service was good but thought i would have received a sharps box as its a needle medication. Also the packaging was loft insulation which I thought was a bit strange. But all information and emails through the website was great

918	918	"Great and professional service,"
919	919	"Unable to get correct ointment for an already diagnosed skin condition, it was a ??lifesaver?? to be able to get it from The Online Clinic!  Cannot understand why my local surgery could not obtain it?  Only needed very occasionally, but important to have peace of mind that I was able to get Trimovate from them!"
920	920	"It cost me ?35 to get a prescription that would cost me ?8 if I??d waited 3 weeks, taken a half day from the office then been kept waiting an hour over allotted appointment time. Like I??m being done a huge favour and I haven??t paid into the service for 35 years. So 35 quid for a 72 hour service including delivery is pretty good value isn??t it?NHS- all washed up."
921	921	"Brilliant service from start to finish, can't thank you enough x"

931	931	"A very quick and efficient way to get a prescription, with medicine ar your door in under 48 hours. The positive reviews, UK base, payment only requested after the order has been sanctioned... factors that took initial concerns about possible online scam, Glad I did."
932	932	The responses from the Dr were very quick and effective: they asked for more information where needed and gave me treatments options so I could express a preference. I'd definitely use them again.

942	942	Simple to use seamless service with fast delivery.
943	943	My experience was. They knew what treatment I needed to solve my symptoms.  But I couldn??t have the treatment because of my symptoms? Figure that one out.  Basically the treatment I needed would help my symptoms. But because I had those symptoms they would not help me?  Ummmm what is their service then?   Don??t waste your time guys.

945	945	Easy to understand Quick replys Quick delivery  as promised
946	946	"I'm really not a fan of visiting the GP and, as a typical bloke, tend to go from one year to the next without bothering them. When I have no choice, ours won't schedule appointments and you have to queue first thing in a morning to get one and then come back later in the day. The Online Clinic offers a real alternative and I found it to be much easier and less hassle and will definitely use them again - though it may be a year or two!"

It was not very long before the prescription was sorted and I was advised the drugs would arrive next day.  The postman delivered the prescription mid morning.  The drugs have worked and now all is well.  Will definitely use this service again.
953	953	Good experience. Problem swiftly dealt with.
954	954	there doctors were brilliant and gave me the antibiotics I needed for my dental abscess..I received them within 24hours of been approved by doctor..bearing in mind they came from London and I live in blackpool ..they were sent special delivery and I got them at 12noon the very next day..I'm very impressed with there service..would highly recommend them

966	966	Discreet and professional
967	967	"Compared to other private prescription websites, this one feels more like a proper GP service. They have a messaging system where you can upload photographic evidence of your problem and have a one-to-one conversation with the doctor before they agree on issuing medication. They also issue advice that seems personalised to your particular case rather than coming from an automated system. Well recommended"
968	968	"Prompt service, can't be faulted.  Delivered next day.  Easy to use.  Would recommend."
969	969	"I had a great experience, I just wish that they would take international cards as a payment option."

974	974	"I found the Online Clinic to be reliable and very professional service. I had been directed to the Online Clinic from their sister site, the STI Clinic after having purchased a full STI screen which returned positive results, to undertake a consultation. This required filling out a short online consultation form for their review which  I was particularly impressed with the fast turnaround. This was processed within an hour and was able to provide the required medications. After I made payment the prescription was forwarded to their pharmacy and was dispatched the next day. The prescription  was sent via recorded delivery, in plain packing, which I received the following morning at approximately 10:00.

982	982	Qick and reliable service with good medical oversight and advice. Very happy.
983	983	"Excellent product! You just have to follow instrucitons as detailed, you also might need to stay at lower doses for longer depending on side effects.  Though this massively reduces your appetite you still need to have willpower and not eat sweets/crisps as if you do you will feel really unwell."
984	984	A great and speedy service. Quite pricey though!
985	985	"I was very apprehensive of buying online medication. However, I was happy that the doctor asked quite a few medical questions first and I answered them as honestly as possible. The doctor was thorough and very professional which put my mind at ease. I received my prescription and  medication was sent discreetly by post very quickly.

995	995	Very happy with the whole process
996	996	"Even though the GP agreed with the dx (I know what I have as I've had it before) they refused with no explanation to prescribe a really standard medication. What a waste of timeThe clinic said I chose the wrong category and I am sure I didn't but even if I had, surely a user friendly and patient centred approach is to just issue the questions? Instead I was told I needed to pay for further consultation. Sounds completely inappropriate"
997	997	"Recommended - Quick, efficient and great value"
998	998	"As a medic I was sceptical of on-line diagnosis but couldn't get to my own Dr and knew I needed prescription treatment. The service is thorough, professional , helpful and efficient. Thoroughly recommend for non life threatening medical conditions if you have trouble getting an NHS appointment. You do have to answer medical questions ( which is good ) and I was asked to send a photo , so you have to be reasonably tech savvy . I was very happy and my condition has totally healed."

However the service that I've received from The Online Clinic has been absolutely amazing. I don't really have time to get to the doctor so being able to do everything online and via the messaging service in my account has meant I've finally been able to get the treatment I need for a condition I've had for ages.The messages you get from doctors are incredibly prompt. They are very vigilant and ensure that you're doing the regular blood tests as and where needed. For anyone who wants a quick, no-fuss service and hasn't got the time to get to the GP I would highly recommend using The Online Clinic."

Due to the amount of new pain and increased swelling to the area, I knew I needed to contact a doctor.

1250	1250	"A fantastic service. Installed confidence with the doctor requesting a photo ( skin condition), prescribed medication arrived the very next morning . This could be the way forward!"
1251	1251	The Online Clinic used a straight forward Q&A process to scrutinize my request for a prescription.  The first-time experience was much like a regular visit to a GP. It was not intimidating and was pleasant overall.  The professional services complemented my Internet supported DIY triage approach seamlessly.  Prescription prices and delivery by Royal Mail were suitable.  Why wait three weeks for a GP appointment and a prescription when a face-to-face meeting isn't required?
1252	1252	"Excellent service, incredibly quick decision and reply will 100% use The Online Clinic again!"

Firstly a skin rash on jaw line, asked to send photo, did this and was told to see my GP. Second time conjuntivitis ( OTC drops did not work ) again told to see GP. Having to  wait weeks for a GP appointment is the main reason for using this kind of service. In both cases they got worse because of the delays. It was quite clear what treatment was required. Fortunately got the right prescriptions elsewhere online without issue. Will not bother again there are much better companies out there."
1336	1336	It took over 3 weeks for a blood sample to be processed before I could commence antibiotics.  I think it was only me ringing that reminded them. I've still given a 4 however as after that point communication and action couldn't be faulted

1417	1417	This is an awesome service for those who are fed up with negotiating with GP receptionists to try to secure an appointment for 8 weeks time. Equally for those who are fed up with being fobbed off with an appointment with the nurse practitioner instead of a GP.  The service provided was easy to use and cost effective.  I will definitely use it again and would highly recommend to others.
1418	1418	I needed antibiotics before a dental visit and as requested and diagnosed I was sent required medication following a quick yet trusted and well researched process. I would definitely recommend online doctor if someone??s in need out of hours
1419	1419	"Great experience with this clinic. They take a full medical history and assess you for the treatment/s that are appropriate for you. You can buy your repeat as you need to and if you have any queries there are different ways to get in touch. If the Doctor needs to communicate, you can find this and information immediately in your messages. Really fantastic for those like me who have busy schedules and are always on the go. Highly recommend - a game changer."

Online Clinic provided an excellent service at a time when I was unable to get an appointment with my dentist.
1489	1489	Awful experience. Whole point of this is to save time - just asking for a repeat of a prescription for a skin cream was just painful. Different ??doctor?? asking a question each time. Never again....

1510	1510	Great service and advice
1511	1511	"A simple and quick process - once you have filled in all the details. I couldn't get to my dentists for awhile and knew I had a dental infection. I am actually entitled to free prescriptions, but the cost for the dentist to see me would have been ?20 more than the actual prescription from The Online Clinic. Plus, my dentist is quite a distance from me.It made sense to pay for the antibiotics, rather than visit my dentist. He would only have sent me away with antibiotics anyway,  and probably a Band B charge! The next day special delivery service was 30 minutes later than it should have been. However, I reported this to The Online Clinic and they refunded the postage cost, even though it's free (always included in total cost, never free!.) I am very happy with the service on this occasion and will not hesitate to use the clinics services again,  especially if a dental problem arises between check-ups!"
1512	1512	Great service
1513	1513	"Easy to use, great results. No side effects with this medication. Didn??t feel as hungry but I was still able to eat food I enjoyed but in much smaller quantities. Withdraw definitely recommend."

It is good to be able to be in direct contact with a doctor so you feel like the correct medicine is being prescribed.  In terms of delivery again very professional. My reason for not giving 5 stars is simply the price, I expect to pay a premium but the prices charged appear excessive."

1518	1518	Really quick and professional from the doctor who reviewed my case
1519	1519	A superb level of responsiveness &  contact ability by ??phone - processing of application was rapid - the ability to speak to someone throughout the process was outstanding Nathan was really helpful Overall terrific
1520	1520	From the consultation to the deliver was smooth and perfect. My questions and worries were answered and my order was delivered the next day. Will definitely continue to order my medication through this.
1521	1521	"Absolutely outstanding service!  Had a meaningful consultation with a Doctor who even asked for a picture of the swelling in my case (which I really liked as it means they were actually thoughtful and considering my issue). After approval, I placed order at 8AM and paid for same day delivery as I simply needed the antibiotics urgently.  The delivery and medication arrived at 1PM!  And all this on a SATURDAY! I cannot stress enough how fantastic this service was and is a true life saver as my dentist cannot see me until later this month. I would recommend this service and website to anyone and everyone without hesitation.  5 stars without a doubt!  THANK YOU ONLINE CLINIC!!!!"

I am outwith the system, due to being unable to obtain a positive diagnosis for Lyme disease in Aberdeen.  I feel that I have to devise my own protocol and manage my own condition.  I would imagine that many other people in my position will be sourcing antibiotics for this horrible disease.  Despite having a positive test for borellia bogdorferi carried out at an accredited laboratory in Madrid, I am deemed simply to not have it, which is very depressing.  As a retired registered nurse myself, I feel the system has let me down.."

So yeah, I wouldn't hesitate to use these guys again. Great service."

I decided to try the online clinic.Filled in a simple questionnaire and two hours later got a reply. This was friday pm. I was given an option of treatment which I accepted. Medication arrived on the Monday.I had been waiting to see a doctor about my dermatitis for over a year. Gradually it was getting worse so I had to do something.

However the Dr asked me many questions and although online I felt that they had understood everything and was as good as a face to face meet.  The online help was clear and helpful and gave me everything I needed, even better than a GP face to face appointment.  The medication was delivered very promptly and in great condition.  Brilliant Service"
1816	1816	"I was initially wary of ordering medication this way, however after the prompt response and delivery of my order, I would definitely use The Online Clinic again. Excellent service."
1817	1817	Due to worsening agoraphobia and my normal GP refusing phone appointments I had to use the online clinic. The service was better than I could have hoped. Within an hour of my registering and completing the online form regarding my condition I received a reply asking for more information. Less than half an hour later I had a prescription choice of 2 similar items. I paid and received my medication the next day. If I had been able to get a phone appointment at my GP I still would have had to either collect the prescription and visit the pharmacy or wait till the next day for it to be done electronically. The online clinic took all the hassle out of it. I cannot recommend them enough. I also felt the cost of medication was reasonable. Buy with confidence.
1818	1818	"Very professional service, easy to contact and website very intuitive. Would recommend."

1847	1847	"Asked for Flucloxicillin (antibiotics) to treat a Staph ear infection which I've had intermittently for 6 - 9 months.  I've had X 3 swab tests over this time, each one confirming it's caused by Staphylococcus Areus.  The GP's prescribe antibiotics and will do so again undoubtedly if I can ever get an appointment but this will take weeks.  The online clinic rejected this request for antibiotics. Despite being told what the problem was, the medicine needed it oil X 2 days of online questioning forTOL to reject this very simple request.  My experience has been poor and if TOC cannot even provide simple antibiotics for an ear infection thats been diagnosed by a GP's x 3 times i have to concur they're pretty much useless."
1848	1848	"I was most grateful and was impressed with the quickness of both my case being reviewed by a doctor and their suggestion given as to help with the problem I was having, then to have the delivery of medication the next morning was wonderful.  It would have taken weeks to see a GP and within 24 hours of contacting the Online Clinic I was taking the medication I needed.   I can`t tell you how pleased I was with the whole service from start to finish will recommend and use again - Thankyou"

Thought I must have made a mistake and not put my appointment date in, so checked in their dashboard section and sure enough the date of my dental appointment is present and correct, so no reason to refuse there then. So it's their mistake but if I want to resubmit (the exact same information) I have to pay them ?5 for the privilege.EDIT Error on their part was admitted and they have corrected the problem quickly. Service apart from this error was very good with a quick response from customer service staff."

I never wanted a refund or replacement all I wanted to know whether the medication was safe to use. I didn??t feel I had a safe answer to the safety. I doubt I will use your services again

Delivery was later than expected.In response to your email below June was not several months ago, I completely agree that medication is usually taken straight away however I took advice and tried to change my lifestyle before taking them as suggested before starting them. When I decided to start taking them 11 weeks after ordering them they were out of date which for the price I don??t think is reasonable.I look forward to hearing from you."

2018	2018	"DON'T USE THE ONLINE CLINIC!!!!!!!About 18 months ago I used online clinic to get Antibiotics for a tooth abscess. That all went fine not a problem.. Then the last few days I've had another abscess come up on a different tooth the other side of my mouth, the pains been awful. Lastly night I filled out the form with online clinic. This morning I got a reply, telling me the doctor needed more info. I gave this. Then I got another reply asking for more info. I gave this too. Then I got a reply telling me they couldn't supply the medication because I didn't have a planned dental review. Even though I'd put in the info I will be seeing the dentist next Thursday. It then tells me if I PAY they will look at it again but also unlikely that it would change the decision!So how come 18 months ago they gave me antibiotics in exactly the same circumstances, but they won't now?So I got back online again and did more research. That's when I found 'i gp'. I filled out all the relevant info and within an hour a prescription was sent to my chosen pharmacy for Amoxicillan. AND IT ONLY COST ME ?10!!!!18 months ago I paid ?40 with online clinic for the same thing. With 'i gp' its 30 quid cheaper!!!! Cant beleive it and actually greatful to online clinic for refusing me meds and saving me 30 quid!Just picked up my meds from my local pharmacy so much easier than waiting till Monday for them to arrive in the post had I got them from online clinic.Know where I will to turn to in future now and it WONT be online clinic anymore!

2040	2040	"I was reluctant to take this medication as there didn't seem to be any reviews from people who had taken these tablets and the side effects of taking them were scarey reading.  As these were the tablets that were recommended for me after filling out the online questionnaire very honestly, I decided to give them a go. After taking them for just a few days I experienced a very dry mouth, headache and slight nervousness ( like butterflies in my tummy for no reason ) I percevered hoping that this might settle down but unfortunately it did not. Second week, the medication is increased to two tablets in the morning and one in the evening and the symptoms worsened. I became very anxious , mood was low, dry mouth , headache and to be honest, I felt that bad , I stopped taking them altogether, so I have spent close to ?200 for medication that basically made me feel terrible! Please, to anyone out there who has a weight problem like myself, think very carefully before deciding on this medication. It may not have this same effect on everyone but in my opinion , it's not worth the risk!  However, as far as the delivery, service and assistance offered by The Online Clinic, I have to say it was excellent and my experience of taking Mysimba has no ill reflection on them as I would happily use the services of The Online Clinic again in the future."

2257	2257	"Medication - apparently from the original manufacturer - was less effective than the generics that I had previously purchased elsewhere despite being five times the price. The blister packs had been ripped in half to fit into a tiny box, 20 of  which could have fitted into the outer cardboard box in which it was delivered. Clinic did not honour the discount code that they had previously offered me. Delivery was expeditious."

2262	2262	Good and fast delivery
2263	2263	I found the service to be thorough and prompt. I knew my problem and I needed some help until I got back from holiday and could then see my own dentist. When I saw my dentist he confirmed my gum and tooth was infected and was glad that I managed to get access to some antibiotics and thus relieve the pain and spread of the infection. Thank you The Online Clinic

2279	2279	"Quick and easy to get the medication that you need when your unable to see your own doctor due to work and trouble getting appointments,i would recommend this website to anyone who is unable to see their own doctor as most of us are simply to busy with work and commitments that makes it impossible to see a doctor for minor things when all you need is a simple prescription for something minor,this service understands this and they do the best to help you quickly as possible and prescribe the correct medication for your minor problem or information help if your problem needs specialist doctors,I'm unsure if they do repeat prescriptions for the same problem that is minor so you don't have to see your own doctor just for a repeat prescription,but I'm very sure they will help in any way they can for you."
2280	2280	"From start to finish, ordering meds was very easy and efficiently handled. I felt reassured that I was asked lots of questions to ascertain suitability for the prescription I wAnted, and the process was quick. Communication is great and the website is easy to use. I??ve also had follow up emails checking how I??m getting on which is good service. I would (& do!)  recommend the online clinic and am a returning customer."

2285	2285	"So impressed with this service.  I develop a toothache after root canal which quickly developed into unbearable pain. I had an appointment booked at my dentist but was going into the weekend with awful tooth ache. From experience I was fairly sure I needed anti biotics.  I completed an assessment at 10.45pm on Thursday night, had a response and approval less than an hour later... 2 suggestions of antibiotics and a patient leaflet for each to read. I opted for the antibiotics I was familiar with, paid for them and selected a saturday delivery to be made to my mums address that I would be traveling to.  They were delivered Saturday morning, packages well.  Yes there is an additional cost for this service but I was happy to pay it.  This is perfect for an on the go person who needs urgent but not serious help out of hours .  I have already told 10 people about it as it??s not widely known about and would not hesitate to use this service again."
2286	2286	Found this an easy and fast service
2287	2287	The initial medical seems quite thorough in terms of the questions answered. The information is forwarded to my GP for completeness. There are follw up medical assessments. delivery is fast and efficient.

2289	2289	Excellent service
2290	2290	Easy process
2291	2291	"When my local dentist was unable to see me in a reasonable time-frame, and I also knew that I had an infection that needed antibiotics, then The Online Clinic provided me with a swift and positive response.Ordering the antibiotics online, rather than travelling to see the dentist, also saved me in time and travel expenses, so all in all I believe I came out of this slightly better off.Good to know that in more urgent situations, The Online Clinic is a solid solution.Definitely would use again if the need came about."
2292	2292	"Fast and efficient service, really happy with my order"

2304	2304	"Ordered some antibiotics cos I couldn't get a doctor's appointment for ten days. Online Clinic's doctor directly assessed the issue and prescribed the exact requested antibiotics I've previously taken to successfully treat the condition. The prescription was signed off and I received the medication the next day. Not a bad price for a private assessment, prescription and the medication either. ?39.99 all-inclusive. Couldn't fault the service or the process, and the antibiotics are working well. Easy five stars."
2305	2305	Great service.  I had a recurrence of an ear infection which was treated successfully last year with antibiotic drops.  My own GP practice couldn??t offer me an appointment for 5 weeks!.Went online in the evening and filled out a questionnaire - a doctor requested more information the following morning- after reviewing this I was emailed to say a prescription had been issued. I was offered the same drops as my own doctor had prescribed the previous year so was reassured. Prescription cost 29.99 well worth it otherwise I would have waited 5 weeks in discomfort.  Will definitely use again.
2306	2306	"Great service. Easy to complete forms, read instructions and fabulous quick response. Prescription arrived next day. Kept fully informed. Would recommend to anyone who has issues getting to their GP or wish some say in their treatment options. I Plan to use again soon. Thank you"

2432	2432	"I would not normally use an on-line pharmacy, as I prefer to take the minimum medication, but to help with insomnia I have been taking melatonin, either in combination with herbs or on its own, bought in France over the counter,.I visit France regularly, but this time I did not have enough supplies to last to my next visit.  My NHS GP told me that to get a melatonin prescription I would have to attend a sleep clinic, so I decided to look online to see what might be available.  I know there can be a problem with medical products bought online, so I thought a pharmacy based in this country would be the most reliable source of supply.  The medical questions asked were sensible but not over-intrusiveAnd the prescription agreed very quickly, and arrived quicker than I expected.  So this worked well, and it is good to know that this service exists and could be helpful in an emergency."

The clinic came back with three options and promptly replied to queries I had regarding them.Once I did my research of two of the medications, I selected Saxenda, which I had no prior knowledge of. Once purchased the clinic sent detailed information and a link to a video of how to administer my medication.My medication arrived the following day, well packaged with cooling blocks. I??ve been using it for 6 days and so far, have lost around 6 pounds. I??m feeling more optimistic about losing my excess weight and would recommend The Online Clinic as a reliable and professional organisation. Looking forward to their ongoing support too."
2469	2469	"Quick, easy, and totally reliable"
2470	2470	Very good but use someone other than Royal Mail for delivery as I didn't get my meds in the time I should have.
2471	2471	"Thank you so much. I work 9-5 and finding an appointment at my GP is not easy. How can I stay on the phone for long waiting to get through and if and when you manage to get through, no appointments for that day. How am I supposed to call as early as they open the surgery when I am driving to work. My consultation with your pharmacist was brilliant. I managed to do this viaonline whilst getting on with my work. A photograph of my skin condition which was easy to send. I received my prescription very quick. THANK YOU SO MUCH."

2477	2477	"I was nervous when making this kind of purchase online but I'm glad I did. Both prompt and professional. I filled in a medical form very early Saturday morning. (7am) by 7.30 am a doctor had reviewed my forms and issued the appropriate prescription.  By 11 a chemist had authorised the prescription and posted them out.  Had it not been a Sunday I would have received the next day.  As it was they arrived by 9 am Monday morning. Not only was the service prompt but I also feel confident orduring again as the correct checks and measures are put in place.  Your not buying dodgy goods off the Internet which is always a concern. Price wise, expensive but not prohibitly so. Would I use again? Absolutly."

2518	2518	"The outcome was excellent in that I got the medication I wanted but I had to spend much more than '1 minute' -- that was indicated -- on filling the form, as I have many pills I have to take and that I had to list. What I couldn't understand was why could not the clinic simply ask for a letter from my GP to vouch for my need for the medication, which is not currently available in the UK. I add that the members of staff in the Online Clinic I corresonded with were courteous, helpful and prompt."

2680	2680	"I used this service yesterday at night at 22.24p.m . I used because I have a bad throat infection and I need antibiotic urgently. I saw in website 24hours service and next day delivery but I haven' t seem the ordered need to place until 4p.m . Basically in the website said ' If after placing your order you change your mind then you can cancel the order for a full refund so long as the item has not been dispatched. ' I sent an email at 14:01 to try to cancel the order before the shipment . They reply quickly at 14:21 and they said we cannot refund you in this situation although I received the shipment email at 14:16 one hour after the order is despatched ( was despatched from our pharmacy on Mar 27, 2018 at 13:15). I sent an email to try to cancel because I had not received the shipment confirmation. I lost 40 pounds.  Make sense they took one hour to sent me the email? I don't think so.I don ' t recommend this service"

Think I'll stick with proper doctors from now on instead of trying to save time getting there!!!Edit: I was not asked to go to the out of hours i did that off my own back as i knew the symptoms from previous experience. I answered all questions and even sent a photo but was told i did not need antibiotics. Least i have some now and no longer feel ill with it just a case of waiting for the abcess to go down so my dentist can remove the broken tooth!!"

2908	2908	An easy service to use especially if you just don't have the chance to get to the GP and know what medication you want. I got the impression that the doctor at the other end was absolutely vetting the applicant and their request i.e.. drugs are not going to be prescribed any old how to anybody.

2935	2935	"An entirely competent service from doctors who seem to know their stuff. Would have rated higher if the price was more reasonable, since ?40 for a pack of 10 antibiotic pills is frankly ridiculous. Clarithromycin has been off-patent since 2005, so generic versions are available for less than 60 pence per pill. Even the British National Formulary specifies ?1.60 per 500 mg pill, maximum. Or why not use the parent drug erythromycin instead, which is almost exactly identical and even cheaper still."
2936	2936	Diagnosis and treatment plan quickly and efficiently completed
2937	2937	"The doctor gave a quick response, very fast delivery."

So I have followed your instructions and had some dental treatment.My wife and myself used to visit Mr Ward and his dental practice at 90 Harley Street so we fully understand the huge difference in treatment between the dentists there and treatment under the National Health.With every good wish and happy thoughts, ""Thank you""Peter Bull."

They blamed the post office and the post office blamed them. The outcome was that I had to wait another day for my antibiotics. Despite being ill and my condition worsening due to the delay they couldn??t or wouldn??t send a prescription to a local pharmacy for me to obtain my antibiotics on the promised day. It would have been quicker and safer to go to the GP!"

3114	3114	Good. Could've got here quicker but it was at Christmas time so the post is probably the reason.
3115	3115	Amazing service. When you know the problem it's far better to use this service than wait days sometimes weeks to see your local GP. Speedy and prompt service with delivery too.

I will use this service again."

3143	3143	Clear and precise descriptions of all medication on offer. Speed of delivery is second to none.
3144	3144	Having had UTIs previously and understanding condition and medication required I chose to get antibiotics from this trusted site instead of taking time off work to see a doctor for what I knew I needed. Having a doctor on line check my symptoms was reassurance and my medication was dispensed quickly ariiving in packaging that fit through the letter box ensuring no delays in starting treatment. Will definitely use them again and recommend them to friends and family for simple conditions with easy treatment.  They do not replace a gp for full consultation on complexed issues but a great service when it is to treat something you have had previously
3145	3145	"Very efficient service, order was processed and dispatched quickly.  The only minor inconvenience was that a signature was required to collect the package - since I am not typically at home when the post arrives, I had to arrange a redelivery which took an extra 2 days.  Of course, this is an issue with Royal Mail rather than with the Online Pharmacy, but nonetheless, it is unavoidable when you order from them."
3146	3146	Very fast and straightforward received a response in an hour and medication arrived the next day
3147	3147	"I filled out the online medical questions and submitted my details , my information was processed quickly and efficiently with confimation emails throughout the process and my presciption was then securely sent all within days! Very happy,"

3152	3152	Excellent service and quick delivery Highly recommend as a very professional company
3153	3153	"Fantastic, quick and efficient service. Was the first website I was recommended and was pleasantly surprised knowing how sketchy some places are."
3154	3154	"I feel this is a good service, they are thorough and professional."
3155	3155	"Excellent service, much better than that of the NHS. Better substitute medications as well. Great communication and fast delivery."
3156	3156	I needed help with a dental abscess and found it here. I was panicking a bit because my Dentist couldn??t see me for several days but I feel confident now that I am on the road to recovery by getting a grip early on the problem.
3157	3157	Excellent service! I was asked extra questions to confirm what I needed and once I had answered my choices of prescription were available. I paid extra for confirmed Saturday delivery and my prescription arrived as expected.

3163	3163	Service very good I also would say if they are not happy to give a prescription they advise you to see a GP if they think it needs Basically they will not dish out medication if not the correct and professional and  not in the patient best interest I have used themOn various occasions and always found excellent
3164	3164	"Excellent service. Felt confident in their health screening. Prescribed a fantastic weight loss product, very effective."
3165	3165	"Honestly I would shop here again, I checked out the reviews beforehand and was reassured they were trustworthy as you should always do. Quick service, easy to use online, prompt responses and consultation. Medicine arrived the next day as expected packaged efficiently and my medicine is labelled with professional guidance. Couldn??t have asked for more."
3166	3166	"Professional service, quick and efficient"
3167	3167	Great service. Prescriptions arrive on time and the communication with the dispenser is excellent
3168	3168	"I am sitting here in agony right now because the Online Clinic has refused to help me. I get regular bladder infections every couple of months, but sometimes they don't go away on their own and I need Trimethoprim. The last time this happened was almost a year ago, so it's not as if it happens a lot. I am disabled and stuck at home, my partner would have to take a day of holiday to take me to the GP (even then I'd have to wait a week for an appointment), but his holiday time is already booked for Christmas. I am not getting to a doctor any time soon.Despite this, the Online Clinic seem to think that only my doctor can identify this thing that regularly happens to my own body, and I have been given the infantilising suggestion of a telephone consultation because I can't leave the house. Guess what, I'm deaf too, so I'm just going to be without healthcare. I thought the very purpose of the Online Clinic was to help people who can't see their GPs; if you could see your GP then why would you use this service? I guess they just approve people's first consultations to get an influx of positive reviews, and then stop bothering when you are next ill.Edit RE: reply: I am not ""avoiding"" further investigation, I am literally trapped in my house. My GP has been perfectly happy in the past with the fact that I get such regular infections and she says it's normal for a lot  of women. None of this changes the fact that you were my only source of healthcare and you refused me."
3169	3169	"very simple to use from start to finish, i liked the updates regards to my delivery and i received my medication very efficiently"
3170	3170	"excellent, even the dentist said we did the right thing by using you, as dentist receptionist had told us no appointment for a week"

3172	3172	Prompt service.  Excellent communication.  Quality genuine medication.
3173	3173	Cool service
3174	3174	This was a pain free process to get a private prescription. I had to answer a questionnaire and then a doctor got back to me straight away to clarify my answers. I received the prescription the next working day by special delivery.
3175	3175	"Super fast delivery, my small health problem was solved very quickly and efficiently. I??m a business woman. ...A working single mother, with no time for  the standard GP??s terrible appointment systems these days. Thank you very much for your swift initial reply, (early Sunday morning!) diagnosis and medicine dispense. Thankfully  I could continue with my planned overseas business trip.

Excellent service, and will definitely use this service again."
3214	3214	The service was fast professional and reliable.
3215	3215	Fast service and they make a good job in the online consultation. I was impressed to see they actually care to verify all the information you provide. The delivery is fast and it means a lot when you have a UTI that requires antibiotics immediately  and it takes two weeks to get a gp appointment.

3276	3276	"I was dubious about this at first, figured it would only be useful for the equivalent of going to a pharmacist...however I was wrong. They are extremely quick at responding (even when it was Sunday, in uk Sundays like a dead day you can never get a dr unless you??re on private), it all happens online which for bad signal areas is brilliant. I had a tooth infection which I needed antibiotics for, figured I wouldn??t get them. However got my antibiotics with a promise to visit the dentist. Yes it does cost money mine was ?39.95 yes that seems expensive but when you don??t want to spend five hours in an emergency room (I have a baby that??s just not happening) and have the medicines delivered to your house the next day it is amazing. I anticipate that mums are likely to pick up on this service as we never have time to see a doctor or Dentist (not to mention it??s a big no no to take baby??s or toddlers in your visit with you"

3286	3286	I found this service to be fantastic. I placed the order on a Friday and expected it to arrive on the Monday but to my surprise and absolute delight it arrived Saturday morning.  Fantastic service.  I would definitely recommend
3287	3287	"Absolutely excellent. I'd  found it impossible to secure a conventional appointment at my local surgery - I wasn't actually dying there and then - and didn't know what to do.  I was in considerable distress and pain at 1am and, out of sheer desperation, went online and found the Online clinic. I completed the consultation questions and within 10 minutes I had a prescription! I paid and the medication, antibiotics, arrived via Special Delivery next working day.  Needless to say, I'll be going 'private' with this company next time I'm not actually dying but in considerable pain with an issue."
3288	3288	"Fantastic Service. All contact and emails answered within minutes. Prescription issued and completed so quickly. Postage was next day before 1pm, and arrived exactly as hoped. So quick and easy to use I would definitely recommend. I've reordered twice now and will continue to use them in the future."
3289	3289	"The service I received was excellent and very professional. The people I dealt with were very helpful and advised me on the best medication for my issue. However I had to pay ?40 for a course of strong anti biotics which is extortionate considering I don't even have to pay for prescriptions, I couldn't get a docs appointment for 3 weeks so that's why I turned to online clinic. Other than medication costing lots overall experience was good:)"
3290	3290	Excellent service. I was in agony with my tooth and couldn't get into dentist. Antibiotics prescribed and delivered within two days. Highly recommend.

3301	3301	Very good private service only problem would be with delivery!....why can??t the small box be posted through the letterbox??? Have to take day off to wait for postman.....not always easy!
3302	3302	Good service and prompt delivery. Only reason its getting 4 out of 5 stars is the price wich was almost 10 times pharmacy one. But considering i avoided waiting 2 weeks for GP it was worth the exrta pay.

3304	3304	"Exceptionally speedy service, no nonsense and saved me weeks of being really ill.  I will using this company again as they do what they say they do. I am very hard to please as I don??t like bad service, so they must be good."

Will definitely use again (hopefully I won't need to). Only deducted a star because of the price, but then I've never used a private doctor before, so for all I know the prices are very competitive... Got to remember that the price includes a consultation fee and medication cost... but still... I'm all for paying a premium for good service, but ?60+ for a 30 gram tube of cream was a bit much (I would have paid more thought as I was in so much pain and knew the cream would fix it)."
3436	3436	"Fast response consultation, easy website and quick delivery. Slightly expensive but worth it for convenience."
3437	3437	Very easy and convenient to use. A lifesaver when you cannot see your GP as too busy!

3462	3462	Good professional service with reasonable prices and prompt delivery. I've dealt with them many times now.
3463	3463	"I put in a prescription request at about 6:30 AM on a Sunday- obviously this is very early and well outside normal office hours for most GP's so I wasn't expecting a fast response. However by around 8:30 I checked my email to find I had been instantly approved and I could order my treatment. The medical questionnaire that I filled in was thorough but not overly long- in all it took me around 10/15 minutes to register as a first time user and fill it in and explain my problem to the doctor. It really was extraordinarily easy to use and very fast service. The medicine itself was around 4 times more expensive than if I had gone through my GP, but this included the diagnosis, postage (as it was a Sunday when I placed the order it arrived on Tuesday) and the convenience it was 100% worth it- especially as it meant I didn't have to take any time off work. I would recommend this extremely professional service very highly to anyone who struggles to get to their GP due to a busy life."

3474	3474	Fast and reliable- very good!

3507	3507	"the process is five star, straightforward and very professional with regular updates UNTIL....Despatch. You pass it to Royal Mail. Why?In over four years I have never had one of your packages delivered.I shop online regularly receiving texts or emails from UPS, DPD etc, agreeing delivery slots for when someone is in. I live with a retired relative who has watched from her armchair as the postman delivers the pre-written card stating 'unable to deliver'. It helpfully advises collection times from the local sorting office!Every time!   You did ask for feedback & I have phoned you about this."
3508	3508	Really prompt excellent service
3509	3509	Whilst I realise you're restricted with prescriptions- I don't think it's acceptable for antibiotics to arrive on Tuesady morning when agreed clinically appropriate on Sunday. This is potentially dangerous.

My order was well packaged and with clear instructions. All in all cannot rate highly enough."
3634	3634	"No long wait to get an appointment with your Doctor, describe your symptoms, send photos if required, get diagnosis/approval and prescription and medicines arrive by post the next day.  Voila!"
3635	3635	"I had an abscess and needed antibiotics to clear it up until I could get into my dentist and now I'm clear and no longer in pain. Obviously it costs more but you get next day delivery but either way if I could've got into my dentist it would've cost ?20 for the emergency appointment then another ?8.50 maybe more for the antibiotics, I paid ?40 so not too much over the odds, great service would definitely use again.Thank you OCUK"
3636	3636	Really good service. Item ordered was out of stock but they messaged me straight away and sent it out one day later than originally expected which I was very pleased with. Item exactly as described
3637	3637	"I have almost given up on my local NHS gp. Every request for an appt requires a breakdown of my symptoms/condition with the receptionist which I find uncomfortable - and even then an appointment is almost impossible to come by. A same day appointment is only given out if your illness is life threatening. I steel myself for a battle each time I have to call. The online clinic are helpful and speedy and just easy. This has to be the way forward, and must relieve a little of the pressure on our NHS gps."

3647	3647	Good service and delivery! Can't fault them as a company!
3648	3648	Very easy to use. Quick and efficient delivery. Professional service.
3649	3649	"Problem free, fill in form, answer supplementary questions, make a decision about suggested medications, order, pay, and in my case a slight delay in despatch but communication always appreciated"

3655	3655	"quick and reliable, would recommend The Online Clinic.Thank you for your service."
3656	3656	"Efficient and asked the right questions, didnot just prescribe without checking symptoms properly"
3657	3657	Quick response and fast shipping

3659	3659	"great service, quick and easy transaction x"
3660	3660	Service was ok in terms of contact and ordering however the treatment was not good because I needed antibiotics and was prescribed cream instead that has caused limited benefit.
3661	3661	Really quick and proffesional
3662	3662	Fanstatic team... Got the exact prescription I needed and fast delivery
3663	3663	"Excessive price all told for 1 tube of Fucidic acid antibiotic suspension that has been the mainstay for topical treatment of eye infections for a very long time. Tried to obtain a second tube, but were having none of it have to go through the same rigmarole in order to be ripped off and get 20 questions.Price is about ?3.50 from what I can see."
3664	3664	This was a perfect option for me. Often trying to get into the doctors can be a nightmare and also extremely frustrating when you know exactly what you need to make things better. Very fast and professional service. I would highly recommend and most certainly use again
3665	3665	A very swift service. Doctors handle consultations during the night which I did not expect. Delivery of refrigerated medication was speedy and well insulated. Will be using again.

3681	3681	Speedy service and delivery. Hassle free.
3682	3682	Has been really useful. I work full-time so the online clinic has been really convenient. Would deff recommend. Only con which is tiny is that it says next day delivery but I've found it usually takes 2-3 days.
3683	3683	Reall helpful fast delivery would highly recommend and will difficult use again
3684	3684	"I had to go and collect my parcel as it's a signed for delivery which meant I was delayed in getting it. It is a little expensive but it was that, wait at least 2 weeks to see my GP or go to A+E."

3707	3707	Very prompt and professional service. Much appreciated.
3708	3708	Very good and fast service

3710	3710	Brilliant service. I had an infected wisdom tooth that was only getting worse but couldn't get in with the doctors for another week.

3712	3712	Great service!
3713	3713	"I wanted to get an appointment with my GP and was told that it would be 2 weeks and the medication I wanted, was not available on the NHS, so I searched online and found The online Clinic. At first I was dubious that there was an official online doctor that could assess you and prescribe UK approved medication.I spent a long time verifying the website and it all checked out and I can confirm is 100% safe and legitimate and the medication I have received is real.I started by filling out my details and I told them what medication I wanted. They then assessed me and suggested other medications. Once I had told them that I had tried a precious medication, they prescribed me the medication I originally wanted. The consultation was completed on a Friday at 16.20 and the medication was delivered the following Saturday morning!With this service, you do pay the actual value of the medication, but the time and effort saved is more than worth it!I would highly recommend this service to anyone."
3714	3714	excellent service quicky delivery
3715	3715	Quick order fulfilment but expensive compared to other suppliers.

3742	3742	great service
3743	3743	Very convenient
3744	3744	"This online consultation and pharmacy website is very good, the consultation takes alittle longer than most but this is because they take the time to properly check your symptoms and ask extra questions. The next day postage came as stated so receiving your medication takes the same time as most pharmacy sites.The prescriptions are a little more expensive than many online doctor sites but the advantage is that they are not limited to certain types of drugs like the others so ,as in my case it was worth the extra cost to get the right medication not available elsewhere.The site also gives you recommendations to see you doctor and other advice on how to improve your condition when you are on your med course so I would highly recommend it as a comprehensive, thorough and extremely useful tool in maintaining your personal health.Safe, convenient and easy to use with quick delivery and a larger range of medication than most online doctors sites, well done online clinic."

3807	3807	"My medicine arrived Saturday instead of the projected Monday.Days 1 & 2, I noticed some improvement but then acquired a head cold.  So, it may be a few more days before returning to the nasal spray.Therefore, it's too early to rate the spray's effectiveness.  If not completely effective, I suppose the next step is an antibiotic regimen."

I tried a different website initially which was a waste of time having filled in a very detailed history only to be told later in the day to ""go and see my GP"". I then tried 'the online clinic' and received a very quick response from the GP who did prescribe what I needed. I received the medication promptly too. It is a very efficient service and they also notify you by text when the GP has responded, which is great. I will definitely use them again. Thank you 'The Online Clinic' for a great service!"

I filled out the easy questionnaire on the website, and in a matter of hours my case was reviewed and a prescription recommended there and then. Better than that, it arrived the very next day! Absolutely fantastic to see this sort of service available in the U.K., I couldn't recommend enough."
3867	3867	First class service and excellent product. I would definitely recommend.
3868	3868	I had not registered with a local GP after moving house. Needed some antibiotics very quickly as a neglected tooth filling caused an abscess at the root of the tooth. Hadn't slept well or eaten properly due to the pain. Ordered from The Online Clinic with delivery for the following day. Two days after taking my treatment course (5 day course) the infection is virtually gone. Now to get that filling done.......
3869	3869	Very helpful
3870	3870	"Not always convenient to get to see a GP & sometimes you know which medication your ailment requires. The service is 1st class, received meds within 24hrs. All good now. This service is the future, & will take the financial strain off the NHS ultimately."

3901	3901	"Amazing customer service!!! Have had to order medication urgently and unexpectedly before my next day flight. The girl over the phone helped to cancel the order i've made (as it would have been put through for the delivery the next day, but my flight was midday, so i was fearing to leave home before the delivery). I have purchased an order with her over the phone and she arranged the courier for the same day evening delivery (don't remember, maybe i had to pay the courier service some extra 20?, but i badly needed the medication). Really really appreciated the help!!!! Up till today I am thankful to that girl who was very understanding and helpful."
3902	3902	Very good service and quick.  I suffer from severe panic attacks and going to a dentist or doctor can be very traumatic so this service is invaluable.
3903	3903	"Prompt next day delivery. Hassle free service, polite on telephone and most helpful"
3904	3904	"I've given a 5* rating which speaks for itself. Fast, efficient, professional. Everything is done to a standard of excellence, customer care and service is second to none."
3905	3905	Great service as usual. Receiving a text to notify me that further information was required by the doctor was great - as I was notified promptly by text I was able to provide the information quickly so there was no delay with my order. Receiving and reading emails when you're on crutches and out and about isn't always easy!

3916	3916	Good service
3917	3917	"I thank you for your response to my discount request which makes your service far more professional. It would be better if your site would allow you to continue shopping. As it is the discount only applies to one product.You say I can use the 28 discount codes you have sent me, that is strange because they are always Return10. I try it on every purchase but it only works when I have received the email and only for one purchase."

3953	3953	I have zoon's balanitis and this is one problem GUM clinics do not want to treat. Going to my female doctor is a waste of time. The online clinic has been far more helpful with prompt despatch of my order.
3954	3954	"Fast, reliable and genuine service will definitely use again."
3955	3955	"Everything was very efficient and smooth, I appreciate that the medicine was delivered next day. I wish the medicine was a little bit more valuable price. However I recommend to use this online clinic if someone knows exactly what symptom you have but don't have time to see the doctor."

3957	3957	"Order should have been received on Saturday delivery however didn't arrive until Monday.  No mention of Saturday special delivery on parcel,Only 1pm Special Delivery. Company were very apologetic and offered to refund delivery charge *Still waiting*.While delivery hiccup, the actual consultation and and order process was exceptional, as was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and doctor that I spoke to. While undoubtedly expensive for a course of antibiotics the fact that I didn't have to try and get a GP appointment and take time off work made it very worthwhile. I will certainly use again and recommend them to others."
3958	3958	Great service. Highly recommend this company and will definitely use again.

3973	3973	"Totally reliable service. Next working day delivery, as promised, every time."
3974	3974	"I required a fast delivery of specific medication. This was what happened with a relative minimum of admin\checks to go through. I was a touch disappointed in the response to my pre-purchase query, as it hardly constituted an answer, more like just a restatement of the initial prescription , which I was enquiring about. .other than that, a good and seemingly accountable service which I 'd recommend to any intelligent user in need."
3975	3975	Easily ordered. Arrived on time. Whole procedure no problem.

4024	4024	"If you're working and you haven't got the chance to visit your GP, this service is brilliant. Medication prescribed and sent efficiently."
4025	4025	"The initial online consultation was straightforward and completed quite quickly. The prescription (for antibiotics) was despatched promptly and arrived the next day, as promised.  At this point I would have happily awarded the Online Clinic a five star rating.However, at the end of the seven day course of antibiotics it was clear that a further prescription would be needed to eradicate the infection. When I tried to arrange this I found that the web site was temporarily unable to undertake this function.When I contacted the Online Clinic they informed me that they were making improvements to their '... back office systems and diagnostic tools..' and were consequently unable to process consultations or take  orders at that time. The situation would not be rectified until the following week at the earliest.My inabiity to obtain a necessary repeat prescription in a timely manner means I can only rate the service at three stars."

4032	4032	I registered.  Completed online consultation form.  More information was required and given.  Doctor approved.  Following day I received an email saying they are making improvements to their back office and cannot process my request!!!Totally wasted my time and delayed receiving medication that was urgently required.
4033	4033	Great service......fast consultation .....well managed ......and speedy service....never had an issue....highly recommend
4034	4034	"The process was simple from the start.  The ordering was simple, delivery on time and effective.  My only concern is that one needs to pay for a prescription for all repeat orders making the transactions costly.  It would be good to explore whether a repeat prescription might be an option from the clinic."
4035	4035	I have always had a first class service from the online clinic. Would highly recommend.
4036	4036	The service was very good and helpful

4038	4038	"Working a good distance away from my GP, I dont always find it easy to get to the GP's. The Online Clinic has been a life saver :-) Fast and efficient! Have recommended them to friends and family."
4039	4039	"The consultation and approval process took much longer than advertised on the website; I had to follow up and was advised that the doctors were very busy that day so the process was taking longer than usual. Medicine was dispatched as promised; however, it would have been useful to know that it had to be signed for on receipt.  Royal Mail unfortunately took it to my nearest sorting office, which I was not able to get to for another 2 days.  If I'd realised this, I would have had the medicine delivered to my office address."

4044	4044	I had issues with an abscess on my gum.I was unable to get a perscription through my GP so contacted the Online Clinic. I filled a questionare in online and this was assessed by the clinic. Once assessed they contacted me within a couple of hours to say I was eligible for a perscription of antibiotics. The perscription was sent by recorded delivery and arrived the next day.to be honest it is more expensive than a normal perscription but needs must and I would defiantly use the clinic again.

I was exhausted and had not not made it into work. On the 5th night of very little sleep it was 4am and I was desperately searching the Internet for something to help me when I came across The Online Clinic. Thank goodness I did.The whole process was convenient, efficient and professional. I filled in the online form and everything was taken care of.

4073	4073	Usually very satisfied but last order was placed at 5pm Friday and was expecting delivery on Monday but did not arrive till Tuesday.Explanation was that pharmacy was closed for stocktake over the weekend .

Following a thorough consultation, and discussions via email from the GP involved, I received the medication I was seeking quick and efficiently. I will obviously see my own GP should my condition not improve however, as a 'one-off' use of this service, I found this service to be faultless and very reasonable in relation to private fees."
4085	4085	My experience with the online clinic has been trouble free. The chosen medication arrived promptly with Special delivery and was able to take the chosen medication immediately. The online doctor gave a selection of medication I could take under the prescription.

4091	4091	"I have a difficult job which my work hours that I do  on call can't let me go to the Doctors all the time so I can't get the medication I acquire until I see a doctor and then have to wait 4 weeeks , so when I came across this website I thought I would try it out. I have to say the question where reasonable easy to answer and the doctor who got back to me was quick and pleasant to communicate with.

4104	4104	"Allows access to treatment not available to me on the NHS, probably due to cost implications. Assessment through to delivery all as expected, and thorough. My only reservation is that you could falsify the assessment, and withhold information from your regular GP. This may later put you and your GP at risk."

4138	4138	Highly professional service which takes account of individual needs then meets them promptly and efficiently. Strong recommend.
4139	4139	"When you need an antibiotic, prompt service is critical, and the way that doctors are so inaccessible makes the Online Clinic the only answer."
4140	4140	Being a travelling shift worker this service is a blessing! I never know where I'm going to be or what shift I will be doing so booking doctors appointments are a nightmare so using online clinic makes it all so simple.
4141	4141	"As a first time service user I found this service to be of a high standard.  Whilst there was some miscommunication relating to a technical issue, the staff member I spoke with we went out of their way to rectify the error which ensured my order was met .  The staff were personable and professional with the needs of the customer clearly prioritised."

4147	4147	Great advice and service from you guys

4149	4149	Great service and genuine products. Have used many times before and will continue to do so.
4150	4150	prompt and unproblematic
4151	4151	Very quick assessment and despatch - 7 day wait to see a doctor - makes sense to be able to get antibiotics next day - Highly recommended
4152	4152	Brilliant quick service. My GP is absolutely useless and treat me with no respect or consideration. Hence I turned to online clinic and  would definately recommend.
4153	4153	"Easy navigationable website, prompt service ... recommend to anyone"
4154	4154	Dental infection and needed antibiotics as dentist missed it good prompt service if a little on the expensive side
4155	4155	"Website is informative and easy to use. Information was reviews by doctor and prescription was offered very quickly with the medicine I expected. Payment was taken securely online and the medicine was dispatched the same day via recorded delivery. No issues at all, great service."
4156	4156	Excellent service and fast delivery. Would recommend
4157	4157	"I had an awful cystitis and my nearest clinic would not give me an appointment before 2 weeks (they closed my local one); with The Online Clinic I received my antibiotics the day after my order. I know these orders are expensive, but when you feel disabled and desperate, The Online Clinic is a great solution."
4158	4158	"Like everything I'm very wary of getting medications on line. I have the medication checked by boots before taking. All 100% above board. After trying to get a dental appointment, and last resort see my GP. I turned to this sight for antibiotics to fight a front tooth abscess. The only criticism I have is that you do not get to speak to anyone. Advice given on pill packet to still gain advice from dentist. Fast response and delivery. Without this service I dare say I'd still (as I am doing) be waiting for assistance from my dentist with a severe tooth abcess. Thanks to getting the antibiotics quickly, and pain killer, the pain and swelling on my face is now manageable."
4159	4159	Very reliable and fast service
4160	4160	Great steady service
4161	4161	"I made enquiries regarding Online Clinic's procedure and pricing. I wanted to know why the costs are far above that of certain competitors, as I suspected that perhaps the competitors are selling generic products. Online Clinic rep was apparently passive aggressive and would not provide a straight answer. Not a business I feel I can talk with if I have concerns as a customer or patient. Otherwise fine."
4162	4162	Very easy and simple to fill the consultation form followed by a rapid turnaround of dispatching of product to my front door in less than 24 hours. Top Work!
4163	4163	"While I would always visit my GP if I experienced unfamiliar symptoms, I used the Online Clinic when I began to to experience the familiar beginnings of a chest infection. I know which medication works for me in this circumstance, and since I was under time pressure at work, I was glad to try out an online treatment service. I found the Online Climic easy to navigate and felt confident that I was being carefully analysed by a doctor asking sensible questions. The service was extremely efficient and my medication arrived within the promised time frame. I will definitely use The Online Clinic again."
4164	4164	"Easy to communicate with them, fast & efficient service and delivery. Would recommend"
4165	4165	"I have a periodically recurring minor health issue. However, because I was asking for a repeat prescription this immediately flagged up a much more detailed consultation. I considered that to be first class health care over and above just supplying medication for profit. The questions asked were thorough and detailed and so when my request was subsequently granted I believed the right treatment for my good health had been carefully considered. And of course there's the next day delivery which means one can swiftly begin to put things right."
4166	4166	"I knew i need antibiotics to get rid of my cystic spot as have suffered from this before, but knew :a) it would be impossible to get an appointment with my local GP unless I waited 2 weeks for an appointment or took time off work to go in the eve / afternoon.b) the GP would not subscribe antibiotics to me.The prescription was expensive, but it was worth it. Would use this service again."
4167	4167	A great service provided as always
4168	4168	"My enquiry  was dealt with quickly and professionally ,and once passed my order arrived the next day ,very professional service."
4169	4169	"I found the entire experience with the Online Clinic to be a very positive one. I was impressed by the thoroughness of the online consultation questions, as i believe this to be very important in order to prescribe patients the correct and safe medication.Delivery was as promised and came properly packages as the medication needs to be kept in a fridge.Overall I am very happy and would recommend the Online clinic to anyone."
4170	4170	Speedy and confidential service. Highly recommended
4171	4171	"Great service, particularly useful if you need a repeat prescription but have not time to get to the GP. Very professional and reliable. I will certainly be using again"
4172	4172	Just what was required and arrived next day we use again
4173	4173	Very fast service and delivery.
4174	4174	"Simple process of registration, online consultation had appropriate questioning and was prompt, choice of available treatments was given accurately, delivery was outstanding, next morning. Only downside, my fault for not reading the appropriate detail, was minimum order amount was ?29 or so (substantially more than the price of the single tube I bought).. Had I realised I would have made up the order number to more tubes."
4175	4175	Quick response and helpful advice given.will use this service when needed.
4176	4176	Was able to get an online consultation and delivery of medication within 24 hours. It took less than 10 min of my time and was very easy.
4177	4177	I was not able to get a gp appointment for a throat infection and couldn't wait for the next available appointment so I decided to try this service. I was really happy and received my antibiotics very quickly. Will definitely do this again Thankyou
4178	4178	"Easy form to fill in, very quick reply, good choice of tablets to choose from, discrete parcel arrived next day."
4179	4179	Quickly despatched and communication excellent
4180	4180	Not having had need to use service like this before I had some reservations but the whole procedure from online Doctors review to delivery of item was very professional and efficient. You are regularly informed of how your order is progressing and delivery is exactly as they promise.
4181	4181	"Got what I needed in excellent time with no fuss. No getting to a surgery and sitting and waiting for ages in germ filled waiting rooms. Just fill out a questionnaire which gets checked by a doctor, they then confirm their decision, within about 24 hrs and then a few days later, you have your meds through your door! Perfect! Would definitely recommend!"
4182	4182	I knew I had a throat infection but for one reason or anything getting to the doctors wasn't easy.  I'd never used an online prescription service before and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was.  There was an online form to fill in about medical/personal details and then my request was submitted.  I heard back from a doctor with a couple of questions and my request for antibiotics was prescribed.  I was then given the option of 3 types of antibiotics - this was the only slight hitch in the process as it didn't provide any descriptions (there was a query button to press but this was blank on opening) so I just looked them up on the internet instead.  Checkout was quick and I received my medication the next working day in a discrete brown box.  Very pleased with the service and I would definitely use them again and recommend.
4183	4183	thank u v much
4184	4184	"I find the online clinic a god send. It is difficult to get a Gp appointment when I know I just need antibiotics for a long standing problem. They are quick, convenient and fairly priced."

4190	4190	"Very trust worthy and excellent service, can't fault. My prescription arrived next day"
4191	4191	I developed a horrible infection of my outer ear. I've had this before and knew which medication had cleared it up. I wasn't able to get an appointment with my GP and it was a Friday so I didn't want to suffer with the pain in my ear until Monday. Within a few minutes I had registered with The Online Clinic and had filled in the form with my medical details and symptoms of the condition. We I was emailed confirmation of an available prescription within an hour of them opening for business. I was able to pay for the prescription and get confirmation of the order straight away. Later that day I received the tracking number for special delivery. Today is Saturday morning and I've just received the prescription. I'm getting immediate relief within the space of a day rather than having to wait until Monday. I can't recommend the service more highly! Thank you!
4192	4192	Good service
4193	4193	refused antibiotic for throat infection even though old med tablet nearly got rid of it in two days but ran out ...no better than a google doctor. Disbelieved that I could have any comprehension of what I was talking about just upsetting really ...I wouldn't even waste your time.

4204	4204	Have found the On Line Clinic to have the highest integrity when dealing with them giving you the satisfaction of knowing that you have been dealt with correctly.

4216	4216	"The average waiting time for a GP's appointment is about 2 weeks at my surgery, unless I can get down there from 1pm to wait for an on-call doctor (which is not possible!) I found the whole process easy and efficient and was approved for antibiotics on the same day. The only issue was that the antibiotics I chose were then out of stock - it would have been better if the pharmacist could have posted a different type/brand, because I then had to wait three days for the tablets rather than getting them asap. The service was good though and everyone was really helpful."
4217	4217	After applying for some antibiotics. I received my review and brought them. Tablets arrived next day delivery excellent service

4232	4232	"After finding out that I would have to wait 4 weeks to see my GP and feeling miserable with Sinusitis, I decided to try The Online Clinic. I did my checks, ie ensuring that they were bona fide and also the Pharmacy. Once completely satisfied I went ahead and contacted them. I received the diagnosis the same day and approval for medication. I was able to ask for alternative antibiotics to the one that was originally prescribed and I received them the following day. Extremely impressed with the whole service and I was kept informed at all times via email. Feel really well now thanks to these Doctors and I would recommend The Online Clinic to anyone. Absolutely brilliant! Thankyou so much."
4233	4233	Excellent service for people who don't have time to go see a local GP.
4234	4234	"only ever orderded twice from the online clinic, i found them very professional and helpful, nothing seemed a problem to them and i recieved my order within a few days. well done ."

4239	4239	Qiuck and efficant with high level of care given.... The one and only down side is it's on the exspensive side in comparison with online sites.

4244	4244	"Like many people I was somewhat reticent to purchase pharmaceuticals online, however, a painful abscess and inability to access dental treatment in a timely manner put paid to that reluctance. I needn't have worried. I simply filled in a form which was assessed by a doctor, made reasonable payment and the antibiotics were delivered the next day. I would happily recommend this company."
4245	4245	"Excellent help quick delivery. It was good that you were asked to answer questions as to why you had requested the medication, as this was a safe way of doing it, to ensure that you were ordering the right medication for the right reasons. The only negative i would say, is that there a few too many questions to be answered. Also having to recieve several emails to let you know if you were able to recieve the medication etc. It got a little bit confusing. But overall excellent service, with quick delivery & quick replies to emails when i was asking questions. Especially when asking for estimated day/date of delivery. Also discreate packaging. The only negative is that you have said that you would have to inform my GP before allowing me to order anymore. Which i don't want you to do. I am sensible with my medication."
4246	4246	Excellent service and fast delivery would definitely recommend and will be using again.
4247	4247	"Excellent service! it didn't take long for a doctor to review my online consultation, using this service has been a huge help. My medication came the next day once approved. It was a little pricey but you pay for the service. I'd definitely use again if I need anything else. Thank you."

4249	4249	Easy to use; queries came back fast and request was dealt with efficiently. Will definitely use again.
4250	4250	"For very obvious reasons, I was very dubious about buying a prescription drug online - but circumstances forced my hand. After doing quite a bit of research I took the plunge with The Online Clinic and am very pleased with the speed and courtesy of their service. They do appear to be the real McCoy. I almost never give 5 stars - and never on a first experience - but came close to it this time."
4251	4251	I find ordering from the Web site very easy and have fast delivery
4252	4252	Very quick and efficient service that is incredibly easy to use. From registration to prescription being issued (including consultation) was less than two hours and treatment arrived pre-1 the next day as promised.
4253	4253	I found the company was excellent. The website and consultant service was very easy to use and quick. The item was posted very quickly and arrived as arranged. Highly recommended.
4254	4254	"Good to have an option to use a service like The Online Clinic when you need a prescription but for whatever reason such as being away from home it is not possible to get to see your GP. I knew what prescription I required (based on previous experience) but I would recommend giving them a call if you are not sure as the staff are genuinely helpful, well qualified and know what they are doing."
4255	4255	Great service and fast delivery.I would strongly recommend to many one who cant make it to there own doctors Great service
4256	4256	Easy to navigate and the service was professional and quick. Very reliable
4257	4257	Helped when I could not get time off for dental appointment for gum infection. Straightforward and easy to use website
4258	4258	Placed an order last Friday and received an e-mail confirming that the prescription had been issued and was awaiting pharmacist approval. When I checked again on Sunday the order still had the same status. Based on this I went to run some errands on the Monday and returned home to find a card left by Royal Mail that they had attempted delivery. To add insult to injury I then also received an e-mail from Online Clinic on  Monday to inform me that the item had been dispatched on Saturday. Given that the business model is based on convenience for the customer this experience was as inconvenient as it could have been.
4259	4259	"A comprehensive online consultation. Fast diagnosis & treatment plan. Saved waiting to see own GP, in fact better service! Highly recommended for non urgent health issues."
4260	4260	Excellent service
4261	4261	"I had initial problems with the website, which after the consultation phase was showing that the medication had been purchased when it hadn't. I reported the problem, it was fixed and I was then able to purchase to medication. All other aspects of the service are very good,"
4262	4262	Found the service very easy to use. They were very professional and the medication was delivered within 24 hours. I would recommend the online clinic to my friends and family. As for the cost I found this very reasonable and saved me taking time off work and waiting a week for an appointment.
4263	4263	"Extremely thorough with their enquiries, the service was very efficient and my order arrived exactly when they said it would. What more can you ask for. I would definitely recommend The Online Clinic"
4264	4264	Can't recommend highly enough. So trustworthy and such a fabulous service. Thank you to The Online Clinic!  My order was fast as lightning! I was guided every step of the way.
4265	4265	"Having suffered from UTI's in the past I expected my new GP to issue a prescription on request but especially after I had supplied a specimen for testing, instead I was asked to supply a second specimen. When I heard nothing from the surgery by the next afternoon I rang and was told they had sent the specimen to the laboratory and the result should be back by Monday; as it was then Thursday I did not think I could safely wait that long.I found The Online Clinic on Google, filled in a simple questionnaire, within half an hour it was confirmed that a GP had authorised antibiotics and after making payment I was told the drug would be sent to arrive by Saturday. The antibiotics arrived by morning delivery and I was able to start the treatment, I am now half way through the course of tablets and am free of pain and feeling much better."
4266	4266	Fast and efficient service. Really helped me out when I was in agony and would highly recommend
4267	4267	Very professional and efficient service. Would definitely recommend and use again.
4268	4268	I had a consultation with the online clinic due to an ear infection. The consultation was a very quick form and very straight toward. I received my antibiotics just over 24 hours later :) very pleased and will use this service again!
4269	4269	Upon inquiring about my order i got a fast and courteous reply with my medication arriving as specified early the next day. The medication is as said all above board and is as you would get at any walk in chemist. I had recently moved and not got around to registering at a doctors or dentist in my area so this service saved me considerable pain and discomfort. I highly recommend it The Online Clinic.

4275	4275	"Now that getting a GP appointment is so difficult there really needs to be a quick and easy way to get repeat prescriptions without hours on the phone or waiting at the surgery. The on line consultation was a very quick and easy process. It transpired that my usual medication had been discontinued but this was no problem, a number of alternatives were suggested and the medication arrived the very next day. Great uncomplicated service!"
4276	4276	I found it to be a quick and professional service. I needed dental care urgently and it worked thank goodness as getting a dentist appointment is worse than getting a GP appointment.
4277	4277	Excellent serviceRecieved ordered item within 24hrs

4282	4282	Excellent service cannot rate it highly enough.
4283	4283	It was a great service and I didn't have to wait for long to get what I needed.??
4284	4284	"Fantastic service, best company online"
4285	4285	"I cannot fault this service whatsoever. Absolutely excellent service, extremely fast and quick delivery. However, I'd highly recommend writing your symptoms in as much detail as possible in order for the doctor to be able to sign the prescription. I have a spinal defect from a RTA and don't get out much and this service was 10/10."
4286	4286	First time user and was unsure of the service and outcome but I needn't have worried as they handled my order in a first class manner
4287	4287	Prompt and quick delivery and a big help to my needs. Many thanks.

4290	4290	"Very straightforward, prompt delivery and exactly as described.  I will definitely use them again"
4291	4291	So I was sceptical at first about online pharmacies like Im sure many people are. I can honestly say this was fast and reliable with no problems. I struggle getting into my doctors at times I have to wait weeks so this service provides an alternative to that. They make sure you are treated right and the doctor approves treatments for you once you have filled out the forms with all your symptoms etc. I would 100% use these again.
4292	4292	"Did just what it said on the tin, very speedy service, would highly recommend"
4293	4293	"Very responsive service, from start to finish my order was ready and approved before the end of the day. Very impressed with the level of service i recieved, highly reccomended."
4294	4294	"Swift, easy and efficient. Only reason not to give 5 stars is that it is perhaps a little pricey if, like me, you are only essentially looking for a repeat prescription."
4295	4295	"The doctor I spoke with was professional and understanding towards my condition, after which I was prescribed with the appropriate medication to help alleviate my pain, I can now function better on a daily basis with work/university, as my pain is now more controlled."
4296	4296	Good reliable service. Prompt delivery.
4297	4297	Very efficient service. Decision made within minutes. Posted out and received within 2 days. Would definitely recommend.
4298	4298	"So professional, lots of questions to make sure you're telling the truth. I was waiting a long time for my tablets to be approved but I thought that was good because my case was being considered professionally. Thank you"
4299	4299	i found this way of getting advice and treatment both speedy and professional

4307	4307	"I'm very happy with my experience of the online clinic. The service is professional, excellent and very fast, and would not hesitate to use them again.  I am now finally getting my weight under control after years and years of struggling, thanks to them.  Many thanks!"

4312	4312	"Fantastic site, thorough consultation. Regular updates regarding consultation. Received next working day. Highly recommend this service it helped me greatly and I will definitely be using them again. I like the fact that they do a thorough consultation and it is reviewed by a doctor. If they require more information they ask before prescription is issued.Didn't have to put in any payment details before my prescription Request was approved.5 star service. This will be my future pharmacy - I'm disabled and find it difficult to get to my G.P for Appointments and for prescriptions and to collect my prescriptions so this service works very very well for me !"

4327	4327	Good fast service
4328	4328	I have used the Online Clinic a couple of times and am very happy with the service.   It is extremely helpful when you can't get to a doctor and feels very secure and trustworthy.

I received it the next day late morning. Excellent service. Thank you."

4464	4464	"After suffering from a dental issue, I got in touch with The online clinic to prescribe me some medication. I thought it was a good sign that they had a meticulous process before issuing any medication. The form was very detailed and you could tell they were a professional company with how user friendly and smart their website/forms were.I also had a query about the medication I was going to receive,and spoke to one of their doctors over the phone. They were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and I really appreciated their help.

4584	4584	"I had never ordered medication before online and so I was apprehensive about doing so, however I was in so much pain at the time I was willing to take the risk. Having done so I'm glad I did, to start off the consultation result was extremely quick, a couple hours, following that as promised the medication prescribed was mailed to me next day. I noticed it had been checked and signed off separately by a registered pharmacist. I was still a bit paranoid at that point that I may have bought an expensive placebo. It's been 6 days now on the medication, just about to come to the end of my course and I'm very pleased to say the infection has cleared up and I'm completely pain free. If I'm ever in that much pain again I'd definitely use The Online Clinic, can't fault them."
4585	4585	Very quick and easy way to get a prescription
4586	4586	"Have used the Online Clinic for a few years now & have throughout that time found them exceptionally kind, professional and attentive to assisting my health requirements with fast efficient dispatch ofMy prescriptions straight to my home next day when often speed is essential in administering to a poorly part of ones anatomy.

4587	4587	"I have used The Online Clinic twice now, and I am very happy with the service, and the speed with which they process and order. I will have no issue in using their services in the future.

4590	4590	Great service received. Very quick and prompt response from the pharmacy. Delivered next day by Royal Mail.
4591	4591	"Great service, very easy to use and great delivery. Highly recommend"
4592	4592	My delivery through Royal Mail went spectacularly wrong with this order - I won't go into details as that's not the fault of The Online Clinic.It did mean I had to deal with the customer services of the clinic however.They were very helpful as far as they could be but were only able to give me the information I already knew by using the Royal Mail website as I had done.Considering the fact that a package of drugs had potentially gone astray there wasn't too much urgency shown by them.They were however very professional and called back as quickly as they could.Eventually the package appeared so all well in the end.The ordering process is simple and fast and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them.***UPDATE*** As shown by the impressive and very prompt reply from The Online Clinic below - to a problem that was not their fault to be fair - they are as I said a company I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
4593	4593	I had been feeling ill for a while and couldn't get an appointment for tonsillitis. What a super and professional service from Online Clinic. I received my medication the next day without any fuss. I shall continue to use this wonderful service. I'm extremely thankful

4600	4600	"Experiencing severe toothache and unable to get appointment at dentist for two weeks, I just didn't know where to turn.  I phoned my own GP and was told I would have to see dentist ?? Toothache and swollen gum continued to cause pain and multiple sleepless nights. I was taking ibuprophen and paracetamol throughout. In desperation, after yet another painful sleepless night, I went online to see if I could get some help. I found The online clinic and was unsure if it was qenuine, having never ordered medication online before.  I completed consultation and received an email confirmation fairly quickly. As it was a Sunday I had missed next day delivery but medication arrived the following day. I've almost completed the course now and such an improvement ?? I would highly recommend The online clinic. I have the leaflet on notice board in kitchen if ever needed in the future."

4604	4604	Amazing service didnt even leave the house arrived at my door next day special delivery well worth the extra ?9 it works out without all the stress of emergency appointments and prescription costs.
4605	4605	needed some antibiotics fast for a tooth abcess  and getting a drs appointment was difficulteasy site to navigate and purchase what you need after a quick online appointmentused this site twice now and wouldn't hesitate to use again
4606	4606	My order come on the time it stated.
4607	4607	Very quick response and always delivered next working day which is great.!!
4608	4608	"Great products, very fast service, but a bit expensive"
4609	4609	"I used The Online Clinic for the first time a few weeks ago, as I had a severe throat infection and knew I needed anti-biotics. The online process was easy to follow, and the drugs I needed arrived promptly. Quicker and cheaper than seeing my normal GP. Excellent service - will use again."
4610	4610	Fast order conformation and fast delivery. Never had any problems.
4611	4611	"As I work full time it's extremely difficult to get an appointment at my gp surgery. I have recurrent back pain and as a nurse I know what painkillers I need to effectively manage this. I tried the online clinic for the first time yesterday. I told the dr about my symptoms and what pain relief I knew I needed. They were very good and checked I had no neurological symptoms before prescribing me medication. The consultation and ordering of my medication was done quickly and was delivered promptly this morning. Of course it is a little on the pricey side but it's not extortionate and you are getting a consultation, a prescription and fast delivery. I do get free prescriptions so of course seeing my own gp would be free but it would have been near on impossible to get an appointment. I was very impressed with such a fast efficient service and the dr took due care and asked the right questions before prescribing my medication. I will definitely use this service again should I need to it's fantastic."
4612	4612	If you are having difficulty seeing your GP and you understand what medication you need this is the service you can use
4613	4613	I've used The Online Clinic for over 10years now and have always been happy with its service. Reliability is probably my most important criteria. TOC have always been totally reliable. Well done!
4614	4614	I go away on business a lot and having a reliable company to purchase medication from takes a lot of the stress away; it also saves me a trip to my family doctor.Next day delivery is guaranteed on orders which adds a layer of predictability to the service and allows you to work around the delivery of the order.  I would most certainly recommend. Thank you for the great service!
4615	4615	"Very helpful, informative and thorough!"
4616	4616	Excellent service and quick delivery very satisfied
4617	4617	"I am currently taking treatment for ureaplasma after years of urinary and gynaecological symptoms (vulvodynia, urethritis). I'm hoping this is the answer.The tests for mycoplasma and ureaplasma were expensive, but did include medication if any of the tests came back positive.The test arrived quickly and the process to get treatment was very efficient and quick. If you are entitled to free medication with your test, make sure you call the service which provides the medication to let them know. At first this option wasn't apparent because I was using my phone to access the webpage. On a desktop computer the website had the correct information telling me how to go about it.My biggest concern with these services is that mycoplasma and ureaplasma are very poorly understood by primary healthcare providers and even by urologists/gynaecologists, and if so many people are experiencing symptoms but continue to bypass traditional healthcare, these bacteria will continue to be poorly understood within public health services. Never once was I offered these tests by any of the healthcare practitioners I reported my symptoms to. I had to bypass the NHS to get this done. I really hope that the people involved in these faceless online clinics are actually contributing to public health research into ureaplasma and mycoplasma, but I doubt it. I'm concerned that these services have sprung up to profit from a very serious gap in public healthcare."
4618	4618	Great company fast delivery too

Easy use consultation form to complete,  replied within minutes, sent pictures and prescription on its way all within 10 minutes and pleased to say treatment worked,  definitely use this service again."
4626	4626	Such a good idea when you can't always get to see your doctor. Excellent service

After completing the online consultation I was prescribed the necessary cream and I received it the day after paying for it. Excellent service and I'm pleased to say the product worked.

The process was exactly as outlined on their web site."
4647	4647	I had to give a detailed history then I was contacted with a list of medication I could order.  Delivery was next day.  Near perfect services - it would be a 10 from me if you could order in larger quantities but saves a trip to the GP which is priceless in my opinion!
4648	4648	"Like many people, I was somewhat sceptical about buying medicine online. These people are professional and offer a fast service backed by professional medical advice. I would certainly use them again."
4649	4649	Completed form online. My prescription was authorised and I received the appropriate medication next day! Thank you for my speedy recovery!
4650	4650	"If you have had bad experiences from time wasting to sub standard treatment and/or wrong treatment or refusal to listen by NHS the online Clinic is a welcome relief! I had a nagging tooth ulcer reoccur; due to a broken crown from a private/NHS dentist who even noted as he fitted it ""Oh it's not a good fit - we'll try it - come back if there's any problem..."" There was within 24 hours.- and the guy wouldn't deal with it. Then an appalling NHS dentist experience to rectify his mistake has left me refusing to use, as I call it the ""No Hope Service. So was very pleased to be able to purchase a regime of penicillin online - no drawing blanks trying to desperately find a dentist or make an appointment. I ordered just after 4 pm so missed 'next day' delivery but the penicillin arrived promptly being dispatched by SPECIAL DELIVERY the day after I ordered. Life saver as an abscess can if left untreated close the throat and suffocate you - to death. Hence I refuse to call the NHS a ""health service""."

4658	4658	"I requested a consultation at 2am on New Year's Day. Treatment was approved, and a prescription was issued by noon. Despite two days of bank holiday, I received my medication promptly. I'm very happy with the service and would recommend this to those who are unable to visit a GP."
4659	4659	"This is a great service. It's clear, easy to use and fast.  Highly recommended."

I found this company online and it saved my Xmas from being ruined as I was in a lot of pain. I got antibiotics next day delivery. My pain has now gone. I am so grateful.

4723	4723	"Finding the online clinic will change my life. If that seems a little dramatic, believe me it's not! I regularly suffer from a condition which comes on suddenly and without warning, within an hour I can be in so much pain it is unbearable. Getting an appointment at my doctors surgery is difficult under normal circumstances, in an emergency, it's impossible. So much so, that the last three occasions, I have been forced to go to A & E !The Online Clinic is efficient, reliable and most importantly accessible . The site is easy to use and follow and the medication arrived the following morning. Amazing! Thank you Online Clinic and all the professionals who run it."

I was impressed with the level of enquiry from the online consultation- they asked for more information when necessary and are clearly ensuring medication is appropriate to the illness.

4819	4819	"The advantage of this service is you can get what you need fairly quickly. You must tell the doctor everything so that they can come back with a diagnosis and then prescribe your medication. You are also obliged to take all of the medication, especially if they are antibiotics. This type of service works for some things but sometimes you need to speak with a doctor face to face, so there are some reservations. I would recommend this service, but in the end it is up to the individual how they use it."

This ia trustworthy UK based business, not a dodgy overseas operation, better than my GP who seems more interested in talking about his latest golfing holiday than listening to me!"

4997	4997	"The interface for the consultation isn't entirely clear - you have to fill out the right one for particular medications and some conditions could go in more than one category. However, if you call up a real person answers and can tell you what to do. Also, I don't understand why they can't list medication prices - the website says it's because they offer so many medications it's impractical to list them all, but Amazon manages to list thousands of products! However, once you have the approval for a medication the ordering process is simple and fast - I ordered at 3pm at it arrived the following morning."
4998	4998	Excellent service. Very pleased with the help i got. I was away from home and started showing signs of a uti. My gp and or surgery don't believe me when I have a uti as it doesn't show in a dip test with me so had to find help. They even sent my antibiotics to my friends address which i got the next day. I would use again..

5084	5084	"I approached the online clinic after being at the end of my tether with an infection I'd been suffering from on and off for 18 months. Based on my research I suspected a type of bacteria not routinely tested for on the NHS - in fact I'd asked my GP for the test and his response was that I was the first person to ever ask about this, and that he wouldn't even know where to start in testing me for it!Anyway it was actually a blessing in disguise because I came across the online clinic, and sure enough a test they sent me for Ureaplasma came back positive after a couple of days. Everyone I spoke to couldn't have been more helpful. I was promptly called back if a doctor wasn't immediately free, and the doctor listened to my questions without making me feel rushed. I've been given antibiotics (after my GP giving me a different type about 8 months running in the last year) and feel confident that this is the answer to the infection that's been plaguing me for 18 months, and could have even caused me to miscarry a couple of months ago. So far so good!"
5085	5085	Used the online clinic for the first time because i needed antibiotics for a recurring problem. Got a very speedy response. This meant I didn't need to take valuable time off work to see a doctor for a problem that I knew I already had.
5086	5086	I have found online clinic very professional and efficient. They were very fast and happy with service.
5087	5087	"I was slightly concerned about purchasing medication online but went ahead as I had an abcess under my tooth (at the wknd) & was in so much pain. I should not have worried!After completing questions  online which were reviewed by a Dr. I received notification that a Dr had recommended two antibiotics. I chose one paid & received the medication the following day.My tooth is so much better & Im seeing the dentist at the end of this week, as advised by the online Dr.Highly recommended the service, especially if you've had same symptoms before & are fairly sure what's wrong.Thank you very much."
5088	5088	I would use the clinic again.  Very helpful and confidential service. Fast delivery of prescription s.
5089	5089	The order was quick and easy to do. Was manageable to order and complete.
5090	5090	The service I received from The Online Clinic was Excellent. I would highly recommend this company to anyone needing the advice or treatment from a doctor if they cannot get an appointment with their regular doctor. 5 Stars for The Online Clinic.

5096	5096	After being seen three times with a sinus infection and being prescribed the same antibiotic every time I found out what I needed and ordered it. Great service. Fast delivery and no fuss. Regular email updates. I would recommend it to anyone.
5097	5097	"So happy with the complete service from start to finish, very professional and fast service, will definitely be using the online clinic again in the future."
5098	5098	"Prompt, personal and efficient service. Helped me quickly and kindly."
5099	5099	"I needed antibiotics for and infection and couldn't be happier with the service I received.

5155	5155	"I 'd had a terrible flare up of eczema on my hands and feet. I could not pick anything up, and was in constant pain. The online consultation was informed and professional. As it was my first experience with them, I did actually expect some stereotypical advice about the use of moisturiser, etc, for my condition, but was relieved at the gravitas shown, and a wonderful, reassuring, common sense approach which is so welcome when you are suffering. They listen to what you say. I think this clinic is first class. I was desperate, and felt so relieved when my cream arrived next day. I am so impressed with this service."

5161	5161	This company does not just sell you medication. After filling in the question form more questions and follow ups are given. I trust this company more than I do my GP.
5162	5162	I have had a very efficient and fast service from this company every time I have used it.
5163	5163	"I went to a dentist bout a week and a half ago with horrible dental pain. The dentist confirmed I had one heck of a infection going and wanted to pull the tooth but could only pull it a week later. I was rushed out the door with a appointment for the following week and a print out saying take OTC pain relief if there is pain. No antibiotics for a ""raging"" infection as the dentisit put it and it was making me sick and no help from the dentist.Then I found the oline clinic and was able to get the help I seriously needed for the raging tooth infection in the form of antibiotics! The dentisit said he don't prescribe antibiotics period and was suprised that the infection was looking good when he removed my tooth only 2 days ago. told him it was only because I got the antibiotics that I needed because without them I sure it would have been much worse! I will use the online clinic from now on when I have a serious issue and no one will listen to me or help me as this place did when I needed it the most!"

5166	5166	"I was dubious regarding ordering medication online, however this has proven to be an excellent service with the option to pay after delivery.

This obviously does not replace seeing your own GP, but a fantastic service if you require a prescription and can't see your GP quickly."

5230	5230	"There are occasions when it is sensible to look for an on-line Pharmacy. If you see a G.P. privately ,and also pay for your prescriptions it is ideal.  The problem is, which Pharmacy can you trust? Living in the U.K. I will only deal with a U.K. Pharmacy. The internet can give a list of problem Pharmacies, but they do not always suggest a trusted contact. I was lucky, as in a short time I had established a Pharmacy that would use a registered G.P. and also use the questions your own G.P. might ask. I have found this Pharmacy to be perfect and quicker than arranging an appt. with my G.P. attending and collecting the medication. Yes it is quicker than that. The dispensiing Pharmacy is registered and therefore you get 100% the correct medication.The medication can be delivered in one or two days to your door. It is well packed with no indication of the type of contents.  An excellent service all round"
5231	5231	"I am happy to recommend The Online Clinic, the service was very professional and the medication that I needed arrived promptly. I will have no hesitation in using them again."

5235	5235	Absolutely fantastic quick and easy service
5236	5236	Excellent fast diagnosis and speedy delivery worth every penny.
5237	5237	"Professional and fast, clear service as promised."

5255	5255	"Very efficient service, will definitely use again. Highly recommended"
5256	5256	At first I was wary as you hear all sorts about the net. I read the reviews and also all about the clinic and I can honestly say I was very happy with the service and the delivery. Its all at the push of a button so easy I would recommend this site. Thank you will deal with again.
5257	5257	"Good service, reasonable value  for money and easy to use. I will use again, the only downside was the use of ,signed for' postal. I realise this is so that you know it has been delivered, but for me post surgery I am not mobile so couldn't get to the door to sign  for my meds. They were then taken  to the local delivery centre, which I had no hope of getting to. I had to wait till the weekend for another family member to pick up my package. Is there an alternative that could be considered in terms of postage that does not require me to get to the door to sign  for it?"
5258	5258	Overall great service!
5259	5259	"I have used this service twice now and found it to be excellent, very easy to navigate and medication came the next day. Excellent service, the only thing I would suggest is more quantities of the medication but obviously with a restriction."
5260	5260	Found the service to be fast and effective. You will pay over the odds for your products but I see that as a fair trade off as I didn't have to waste hours sat down at the doctors surgery. I run my own business and time is money.
5261	5261	"Talk about convenient!Couldn't get in to see a doctor!But I knew the doctor would start off small, hydrocortisone, eumovate etc and I have to keep going backBut no, I knew even my old betnovate wasn't working so I needed something stronger! I knew I needed Dermovate.My skin is now clear as a bell after a few days using Dermovate. I'm now back to just using a moisturiser, so thank you doctors who listen!!????????"
5262	5262	Fast service no issues will use again.
5263	5263	Exceptional ! Right from how easy and quick it is to place your order to the super speedy delivery ! Thank you Online Clinc ! Xx

5271	5271	They provided
5272	5272	Quick referral & prescription . Easy receipt .
5273	5273	"I found this to be exactly the service that I required.  In these days when you can hardly get to the Doctors (in my case I work 120 miles away from my home town, so difficult to fit it in), it was really great.  I found it reassuring that my case was checked by a Doctor first before the prescription was issued and I had no problem answering the medical questions.  The Doctor reviewed my case quickly, asked for a photo and then was able to make a diagnosis.  The medication arrived the following day and I was extremely happy with the service.

5294	5294	"I am usually skeptical about online services but have been proved wrong this time. Prompt delivery and excellent communication, with difficulty getting to a doctor I would certainly use again"

This company is a life saver because in the past if I tried without antibiotic I would be so much worse even ending up in hospital so many thanks and worth paying for, five starRegards Margaret from Aberdeen."
5297	5297	great company couldn't ask for better service.
5298	5298	"Professional,  understanding and efficient  What more do you want"
5299	5299	"This company seemed very reliable at first--I was very impressed. However, after a short while, they refused my custom on the basis that, because, 'Another account was created that was associated with your account and this was flagged as suspicious'. I said, truly, that I had nothing to do with this other account and knew nothing of it, but instead of taking my word for it, they simply would not reply. This is rude and unfair behaviour by any standard."

5305	5305	"Absolutely first class service . A bit expensive , but so much easier than faffing around trying to get a Doctors appt. Very happy with the service , I will shop here again ."

5308	5308	Great fast delivery securely packaged will use again
5309	5309	"Very good website. Quick, reliable and confidential"
5310	5310	"I was unable to get in at my own doctors due to my hours of work. I found the online clinic and had a online consultation with a doctor.

I will be using this service again."

5313	5313	Helpful staff
5314	5314	"I have no faith in my GP, they are about as good as a chocolate tea pot...So when I had a problem that required attention and I didn't have time to go to a&e I sort advice and help from the online clinic. It was amazing service, I was dealt with and had purchased my prescription from them in under two hours! I even received a text message when a doctor had decided on my course of treatment so I could go online and look and obviously buy my treatment. It was here the very next day. It was obvious that the doctor who had decided on my treatment was very well advised and knew what they were doing as I received the treatment needed, unlike most of my local GP's who seem to have no clue at all. I will not hesitate to use this service again and I am sure my wife, other family and friends will do so too. I have recommended them to everyone I see."
5315	5315	"Fast reliable and efficient, excellent service"
5316	5316	"i have found your service extremley efficient and helpful.the initial online consultation was very helpful to make sure i was taking the correct medication safely.i ordered my medication at 11am and received it the next day,i would highly recommend the professional service that you offer."
5317	5317	"I have a troublesome tooth from time to time which I know with past experience would need amoxicillin so upon my usual struggle to get medical/dental appointments and my forever heavy workload dictating all my time a colleague recommended online clinic which is located on Harley Street London, so after heavily researching them and checking credentials I registered and got an online consultation all for FREE and within the hour my consultation had been reviewed  and medication prescribed ( overseen by an NHS registered general practitioner - NHS number provided) - I paid for my prescription and received medication following morning via Royal Mail signed  delivery ... prescription was how you'd expect it to be ( boxed with inner leaflet & genuine branded)Online clinic saved me lots of time,unwanted hassle and provided a smooth service with regular updates throughout - I thoroughly recommend online clinic to everyone & will not hesitate to use again!"
5318	5318	I had been suffering from dental pain for over two weeks and couldn't get in to my registered dentist... Bless the NHS!!I registered my symptoms and within 24 hrs my new online doctor had provided me with a course of antibiotics and a week later all is good.  I'm now booked in to see my dentist.Many thanks!
5319	5319	"Quick replays, service was great everything was delivered on time and I was constantly updated on my order.I will definitely use this company again"
5320	5320	The service was well described and once order was made it was a smooth and efficient process.
5321	5321	Excellent prompt service
5322	5322	"I cannot recommend this service enough!  I ordered my medication on a Tuesday and received it 2 days later on the Thursday at 1pm as I was told I would by the company.  As a resident of Northern Ireland,  I thought my order might take longer to arrive.  The team kept me well informed and answered any questions I had straight away.  The medication was exactly what I would be prescribed by my local gp, it came in the correct packaging with the information leaflet. I'm very pleased with the service provided and I highly recommend this online company."
5323	5323	Great service from diagnosis to delivery of medication.Thanks
5324	5324	Great service Fast Delivery
5325	5325	"So impressed with this company, fast delivery and it's such a weight of my shoulders being able to order my medication as where i stay the doctors only prescibe tablet form medication which i find not as good as the effervescent, so it's great i can get it here."
5326	5326	"Consultations of mine have been accepted and treatments provided on the same day.If I choose to order the medicines early in the day, I get them the next morning.All drugs are genuine branded or good quality generics. They offer a vast variety of treatments for many common medical problems and make sure the medication is safe by asking your current health situation.A fantastic service I believe everyone should consider using especially given that NHS consultations with a GP are becoming a huge hassle.The prescriptions aren't NHS written, so some drugs are expensive.Otherwise I cannot fault them. Brilliant."
5327	5327	Swift and very professional service. Reliable test results and treatment.
5328	5328	I was in agony with a tooth abscess and having moved recently haven't got round to organising a dentist.  I found the clinic online and the whole process was quick and easy with updates all the time to let me know what was going on. Thoroughly recommend
5329	5329	"Would highly recommend online clinic, they provide an efficient service, with good updates with your request and prompt delivery service."
5330	5330	Fab service. Fast and efficient. Very convenient
5331	5331	"Comprehensive but quick and efficient, order delivered the next day, thanks!"
5332	5332	I used this service and it is brilliant. It was easy to navigate. The people I dealt with appear very professional. I have no hesitation in recommending them.
5333	5333	I found this site very easy to use and it could be a godsend to many in these times of strain on the NHS.
5334	5334	"I realy needed antibiotics for a dental infection but was unable to get an appointment at my dentist or G.P, I found this site online and they were very good I would recommend  worth the cost,  Quick and easy process"
5335	5335	"This was my first order & experience with The Online Clinic & I must say I can't fault their professionalism & duty of care. Before your order is approved, you're asked a number of questions, this is to ensure that you receive the correct medication & advice & shows that they're not just after your money but they do actually care. This medication helped me lose over a stone in weight & I'm so happy, as it was literally effortless. Thank you ever so much, Online Clinic, I WILL be ordering again. Kind regards,Michelle ??"
5336	5336	Excellent service no waiting for order would definitely recommend the online clinic
5337	5337	"I have used the online clinic twice now and found them to be very reliable and quick with excellent order progress reports etc. The delivery is discreet and comes the next day and overall I am very happy with the service.My only criticism is the limit and pricing of medications but they are still competitive and no more expensive than other, less reliable online prescribers."
5338	5338	Prices are a bit high but they have been more help than my gp. I'm in constant pain which my gp cannot find the cause and has had me on the same pain killer for over 2 years despite me telling him it's not working. I came to the online clinic and have found a more suitable pain killer. Just hoping I can get my gp to switch me to it as I can't afford these prices
5339	5339	Super fast delivery and consultation
5340	5340	Fast and reliable!!
5341	5341	"I went to the doctors about 9 months ago and got prescribed with medication! However once this was finished I did not have time to go back and renew it so I decided to go online and check out the Online Clinic website. I liked the fact that this was taken very seriously and before anything was prescribed to you, you had to complete a questionnaire regarding your condition and this has to be approved by doctors first. I am so happy with the results of my medication and I know for a fact that I would have stopped treatment if it wasn't for Online Clinic because I would not have been able to go to the doctors every months."
5342	5342	"Easy service, quick to get medicines."
5343	5343	Easy to use.  Safe and secure.
5344	5344	"The Online Clinic provides expert service, well-informed and with high standards of correct procedure.  It is important that these medications should be handled with good medical knowledge and careful attention to customer needs.  The Clinic is very prompt and communicates well with customers, and it is possible to be fully confident in the service that they provide.  Their charge-rates are quite high; but cheaper alternatives do not provide this level of dependable provision.  Please note that these comments are confidential and are not to be used for promotional or commercial purposes, and that my name should not be quoted or shown in this connection."
5345	5345	I was a bit sceptical to be honest but I got exactly what I needed and quickly. Of course it was expensive but still cheaper than a private dental consultation when I knew what i needed.Modifying the price to something slightly more reasonable would have got a 5th star.
5346	5346	I've used The Online Clinic for four years now and the service has always been first rate and problem free.
5347	5347	"Good communication, helpful when I phoned and fast delivery of the branded medication I requested.Very pleased.  Will use again."
5348	5348	"Found this website after searching for some painkillers. I have them on prescription and had run out. After being approved, my order was processed and it arrived within a couple of days. A fast, easy and reliable service. Thankyou"
5349	5349	"I found the Online Clinic service extremely easy and efficient, I find it iincreasingly difficult to see my GP for a condition that I regularly suffer from, its not always convenient to see a GP especially when working full time and although my medical history is clear to see they insist on seeing you when all you need is a particular type of medication, its a waste of my time and the GP's time, at least using the Online Clinic its a pretty straightforward consultation and although you have to pay for medication it just makes life much easier."
5350	5350	"A company that I will use again, Great customer service, Fast and efficient delivery,"
5351	5351	"Fast, professional and discreet service. Next day delivery as standard (Royal Mail next day by 1pm). I will definitely use them again and will recommend them to friends and family."
5352	5352	My order arrived next working day as promised. Always excellent service
5353	5353	Great service will use again.
5354	5354	"Very promt and wrapid delivery, very good service"

5363	5363	I was delighted to recieve my antibiotics the next day for a very painful toothache.I had to wait over a week for a dentist appointment so was relieved to get medication so fast at a very reasonable price.
5364	5364	Exactly as advertised incredibly grateful for the medicine thank you made a huge difference and tied me over untill dental appointment
5365	5365	"Excellent service, no hassle. Would recommend."
5366	5366	Excellent service in every way - quick and professional.
5367	5367	"Initially I was recommended a different prescription because I did not inform them that I was taking a different drug.  I emailed them using their provided email add and they responded quickly.  Package was delivered promptly the next day as promised.  I also got notifications of where my order is and if it was dispatched, etc.  Overall, no negative sentiments about their service."
5368	5368	The Online Clinic provides an excellent and professional service with fast discreet delivery. Highly recommended.
5369	5369	great service prompt and professional.

5372	5372	I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY.
5373	5373	"I  ordered some antibiotics as I had problems with my tooth but got appointment just a week later. This service just helped me to survive till my dentist was able to give me a treatment.  I was able to work without that terrible pain...  Next day delivery, discreet package and high quality... And reviewing my symptoms takes them just 2 hours. I was really thankful."
5374	5374	"I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your assistance regarding the antibiotics that you prescribed for me,it was quick and easy and will use again.thank you."
5375	5375	I m glad i used this serviceFast delivery

5381	5381	"fast reliable service, no hassle and easy to use."
5382	5382	"I came across the online clinic on google and after logging in and completing a registration and consultation I was promptly notified by email of 3 different medications that would suit my need.  As I don't get sick pay at work and have to use holiday if I need to book a doctors appointment, this service has been a worth every penny."
5383	5383	"very quick with delivery , needed to know a few things but i didn't mind just means there care a little who there give tablets to"
5384	5384	"Very prompt and professional service, albeit a little expensive"
5385	5385	"Good company and do what they advertise, quick responses to any contact with them.However pricing is far from competitive and it is only a last resort if I can't get a doctors appointment and my doctors take up to 3-4 weeks to try and get in."
5386	5386	"I have been very disappointed with my local surgery service quite often.They don't diagnose  very well.Every time i was seriously ill- they sent me back with a handful of painkillers. Since i discovered The Online Clinic, i stopped seeing my GP.They do the whole assessment, diagnosis and not scared to perscribe you anybantibiotic.I am currently recovering from angina ( diagnosed by my GP as flue, refused antibiotics..- they were useless and ignorant).I have been in agonising pain. I turned to online clinic, got my medications right within 1 working day.I am happy...and highly recommend it.Thank you"
5387	5387	Excellent would not hesitate to use again my order arrived the next morning as promised

5390	5390	"Purchase made on Sunday, processed that day, delivery on Monday"
5391	5391	"My meds arrived the following day as promised. Packed in ice which had melted and the package was warm but it was a super hot day! The item couldn't have been packaged any better to preserve the temp. Packaging was also very discrete with no identifiers on the outside. Instructions were really clear and I started taking the meds that day. No side effects experienced at all - now to wait for the results! Happy to review again at a later date. So far, all good!"
5392	5392	"Excellent service would definately recommend it, quicker than going to GP and free, meds were not expensive either. Very fast response and they email you with updates."
5393	5393	SimpleThorough
5394	5394	I was astounded by how fast everything was dealt with from the point of registration. Meds arrived the very next morning. They could teach the NHS a thing or two!

5397	5397	An excellent professional service and items dispatched for next day.
5398	5398	"Difficult to believe quite how important efficiency is when you're in chronic pain, unless you've been in chronic pain!So glad I purchased from this company. A lot of people are mentioning the price but it's not the NHS! You're paying for a private health care service. With next day delivery included in the price, ?39.99 is a bargain when you consider this! Companies like this could charge so much more. Thank you Online Clinic for remaining reasonably priced for the service you offer.Not only did I receive consistent email updates throughout the process of ordering, to delivery, I also had a phone call enquiry promptly answered.I've not purchased prescription drugs online before (apart from my cats flea prevention medicine!) as I have always been told this could be dangerous or untrustworthy, but it's only basic drugs for common ailments that are being prescribed.Personally I think it's a brilliant service and I will use again, should I need to. I would definitely recommend people try this company, particularly if you are one of the nervous sceptics, like me. It's ok, it's safe! don't worry."
5399	5399	Not the cheapest online pharmacy but very high quality service and second to none delivery times. Repeat prescriptions are easier with this site than any other I've used. The only site of its type that gives discount coupons too. Highly recommended

5431	5431	"I needed a prescription medication that could be dealt with by an online doctor. I answered a set of questions relevant to my needs, and I then received updates regularly. It was done quickly and efficiently. I would highly recommend this service."
5432	5432	Quick and efficient. Could do with being a few quid less but you're paying for the convenience of noting having to battle to get into see your GP.
5433	5433	"With us all rushing around and the lack of GPs bookable appointments, this site offered me the help when I needed it, I'm not one for sitting in walk in centres with others, so thank you"
5434	5434	"Online Doctor recommended a few options, purchased one and was despatched and delivered very promptly, in secure and discrete packaging, would recommend to everyone. Will be using this service again."
5435	5435	"I found this website during a period which I was really struggling with chronic illness that causes severe pain in joints, all joints. The NHS has certain protocols and a gp Advised me to look for private treatment. I has no hassle but very thorough consultation. Very happy and would use it again in a heartbeat."

5437	5437	Professional prompt service. 5 star
5438	5438	I found the service easy to use and the questions controlling prescribing were thorough and in depth and response was fast and I was given options of different medication. I found this very good as I looked at all the options and drug info to help decide the best one for me. I found this experience far better than a face to face gp experience where I have never been given choice.

5486	5486	"Fast delivery, very helpful. Would certainly recommend."
5487	5487	No hassle at all. Just fill in your details and your medicines are on the way. For me it's an easy way to get the medicine I need without taking time out of my busy life for an appointment withthe Doctor
5488	5488	"To be honest to get medications without leaving the house is good because normally when you are in pain you don't want to. I have had no problems and the treatment, in my case pain relief, this is a great stop gap measure to my problems. I also know if I order on the Tuesday then the post man will be handing it to me on the Wednesday. So its quick and easy. Having said this if you look through the BNF the medications really don't cost as much as you are charge. Now I understand that doctor that has to issue a prescription but really it does not take more than 4 minutes to do that (review the questions, decide and then issue). So the value of money is maybe an issue. Still as a back up it kind of makes it worth it since it fills in the gap when you can't see your own GP who charges more and asks more questions. Overall, good but maybe the pricing needs to be looked at because its not value for money albeit it helped me out when I require something quickly without fuss. So on balance I think its the go to place when in need."
5489	5489	Found the service to do exactly what it start. My order arrived exactly when I was informed it would. I suppose you get what you pay for (may be expensive but did not feel ripped off) - would recommend using this service.

5628	5628	"I  was born with scoliosis of the spine and have been in pain for as long as I can remember. Over the years arthritis has set in and nerve damage too. I am not a lover of taking medication and prefer to keep fit with swimming, pilates and yoga to minimise any pain I have. Currently I am living in temporary accommodation due to a large work contract. This is while travelling back and forth to my home town as we are renovating our house. The travelling and decorating have put enormous pressure on my muscles and bones. For the first time in years I am having to use pain relief. I don't have time to sign on with a new GP and I work long hours. I was nervous about ordering medication online. However I can honestly say that its such a professional service. I was asked questions about my health and why my symptoms are currently exasperated. A doctor decided which medication suited me at this time. Once I paid the meds were delivered early the next day. The time it saves me is fantastic. I don't need to take time off from work to sit in a waiting room of germs! The medication is a reasonable price and certainly less than what missing work would cost me. For people with a busy life I cannot recommend this service enough. Fantastic."
5629	5629	"Was in big need of some medication for my skin. Filling out registration and application form for the prescription was easy and straightforward. Got my prescription the next day with recommended medicines on offer with next day delivery. Ordered what I needed, and sure enough, got it the next working day! Great and quick service!"
5630	5630	"Excellent service from the Online Clinic, very professional and helpful.I placed a order for my prescription at 3.00 pm on the Friday afternoon and choose the Saturday delivery service, my prescription was delivered by 9.00 am the following day, and i was kept informed by email all the way through the process, would highly recommend the Online Clinic to family and friends."
5631	5631	Loved it got medicine when I needed it most.
5632	5632	"When you don't have time to visit G.P.'s and chemists 'The online clinic' is an ideal solution.The key thing is to provide them with an HONEST appraisal of your medical situation to receive rapid assistance.Based on the clinical details YOU present them with, they will then decide if they can help with your treatment.In my case they decided they could. This resulted in next day delivery of medication for a relatively minor, but never the less annoying, skin condition.Great service!"
5633	5633	"A fast and effective service. Good website and communications. I can't comment on the support team as I didn't need to contact them, which in itself is a good sign!"
5634	5634	A honest professional and safe online clinic. Would highly recommend.

5664	5664	Hassle free and fast delivery ?C everything I could have asked for!
5665	5665	"Wasted my time with lots of other places that require you to have a prescription. This is the only one I found out of about 5 or 6 who don't string you along, and then at the end say ""Oh you need a prescription from a doctor"". One even took my card details and payment for medication before telling me I needed a prescription for that medication. The Online Clinic / Harley Street do their own online prescribing with just a few clicks of a multiple choice questionnaire (about 3 or 4 pages) and then they post you your stuff. It's about three to four times more expensive than at your local NHS GP. Look online for discount codes, for 5 to 15% off. I've gotten 5 and 10% off I think."
5666	5666	I chose the Online clinic for both pain relief and sleep aids and I found the service to be very professional. My orders were with me the next day. Prices are reasonable and I would recommend them to anyone seeking a private doctor service. 10/10

A very professional service and would thoroughly recommend.
5692	5692	This company was recommended to me by a friend and I found the whole experience of purchasing prescription medication online more convenient than ringing up the doctors and having to wait a couple of weeks for a face to face consultation for a fairly straight forward condition that could be treated with antibiotics.

5865	5865	"I am very reluctant about purchasing any form of drugs on line.  I had a nasty chest infection and knew I needed antibiotics, however, I unfortunately saw a GP first who wouldn't prescribe me them.  Two days and five nights lost sleep through coughing later I was desperate and convinced that my GP still wouldn't provide antibiotics, I opted to search on line.  I was very careful and found this service.  I completed the on line consultation and was really pleased when it was agreed to provide the tablets.  It was very quick and they were with me by 12.45pm the next day.  While I do have to say the service was excellent, I do think it very overpriced.  Desperation however did lead me to pay the ?40.  Later the same day I saw another GP who took one look at me and had the prescription pad out so I didn't actually need these tablets.  Such is life and at least I have some spare in case this happens again.  Would I use this service again?  In the same circumstances, definitely, however it doesn't take the place of seeing a GP and would always recommend this first."

I had been having a respiratory tract infection for over two weeks and was getting concerned as I had other medical problems which were becoming unstable due to the infection. My GP had no appointments and the weekend came along. I thought it ridiculous to attend the Accodent and Emergency for such a non emergency. I engaged the on- line clinic. At first I got a refusal and they asked me to see a doctor. Why, I thought they WERE doctors! I reviewed my data and re-submitted with a spelling correction. The data really did not change at all. I got my antibiotics in two days. I'm so much better now. All my symptoms are gone and I no longer need to struggle through my working day. Really good and convenient service!"
6089	6089	Very quick and easy way to get the medication you need fast. My anti-bio tics (for tooth infection) came the next day. Excellent service. Cost nearly ?40 which is very steep but I needed them so can't complain too much.

Don't think they want to recognize bacteria any more!Will most definitely use the service again.Thankyou"
6093	6093	"As a patient customer that is intolerant of waiting for ten days to consult, with cap-in-hand, my conventional family-physician, I welcome each option of the alternative to National Health Service facilities. And if it's as user-friendly and affordable as the Online Clinic has been for me, I'll commend it ?C perhaps as a hint of health services-to-come"

My only negative comment, was that I ordered the medication on a Saturday and did not receive this until Tuesday.  In actual fact a card was left from the post office, as I was at work, so actually this was not received until Wednesday evening.  A next day delivery option would be recommended!"
6108	6108	Had to wait 5 days for appointment with dentist. I knew I had an abscess and needed some antibiotics and couldn't wait that long. A friend told me about this site and they came the following day

6195	6195	"When you cannot get that appointment with your GP, and that is becoming evermore difficult , these are the professionals you can trust implicitly.If you know, or think you know, what the medical issue is ( and who knows your body better than yourself) the Online Clinic will provide a highly qualified opinion based on the information supplied and then recommend the medication necessary. Very affordable (what price your health?) and top quality medication delivered the next day by Royal Mail Special Delivery. My surgery /combined dispensary cannot even come close to those timescales. Highly recommended."
6196	6196	It was difficult to get an immediate doctors appointment. I was diagnosed correctly on line and bought the recommended drugs. They worked and my chest infection has gone. Thank you
6197	6197	I was surprised I was able to write to a Dr about my problems. I am in court this month and its hard to see a Dr in person. Thanks.
6198	6198	I was attending a training Course and could not get to the dentist  straight away  this service was such a life saver for me   Thank you

6206	6206	"couldn't get in to see my GP for 2 weeks, looked online and found this wonderful place while it is a little pricey the service was second to none and i feel much better now. I really dislike my GP and it's the only one for miles so this is a great option for me when I know what's wrong and don't need to see someone."
6207	6207	Fast easy process
6208	6208	"The service was everything I had hoped it would be - thorough, quick and a prompt delivery. Excellent overall."
6209	6209	Test arrived quickly with clear instructions. Results back within expected time. I did get an email saying that they had seen antibiotic resistance to the drugs I was offered after I had ordered them and if I tested positive again they would offer an alternative therapy So im not sure why they didn't offer the alternative drug up front rather than me incurring more cost
6210	6210	Very impressed with the on line consultation and consequential fast processing of my order. It's good to know that there is some supervision of my treatment and that the medication provided is genuine and of high quality.
6211	6211	The service was very professional and quick at delivering the medication that I required. Highly recommend this service.
6212	6212	No hassles and professional
6213	6213	"I had been suffering from breathing difficulties following flu and a barking cough.  I'm not one for visiting the Doctor's but it wasn't going away and after nearly 2 months I thought I was having a relapse.  So I tried to book a Doctor's appointment at my local surgery but they seem to have some kind of on the day lottery booking system.  I couldn't get a local appointment and I didn't feel like sitting in their surgery for several hours amongst poorly people on the off chance of being seen.  Thus I filled in the Online Clinic's online form describing my symptoms fully.  Within the hour an Online Clinic Doctor had reviewed my condition and recommended 3 similar types of medication.  I completed a purchase and the prescribed medicine arrived by Special Delivery at around 11am the next day.  Basically,  the Online Clinic did what it said on their online tin.  Easy, considered, diligent and efficient."
6214	6214	"I had a very bad pain in my jaw and a broken tooth, could not get a dentist appointment at all , but these antibiotics worked wonders and got rid of pain , and very rapid delivery ....."
6215	6215	The service was quick and easy to use. The delivery was on time great if you don't have time to see the doctor at the moment or can't get an appointment straight away.
6216	6216	I needed the medication prompt as I was in a fair bit of pain. They shipped them out to me and they arrived the next day. Everything was perfect and definitely a service I would recommend
6217	6217	Medications came on time
6218	6218	Excellent fast service. Product well and securely packed . Arrived promptly.
6219	6219	It was very prompt an positive experience dealing with them ... With an excellent next day delivery service would recomend an will use again
6220	6220	"Can not fault this company one bit, highly efficient and very very good!! Listened too exactly what was wrong and offered various sloutions. Very quick communication and excellent dispatch time. Highly recommened and will use in future and reccomend too friends!! Very very impressed and no faults whatsoever! I can not praise them enough!!"
6221	6221	Needed consultation and prescribed medicine. Service was extremely efficient and without any delay.Best.
6222	6222	"Super efficient service from start to finish! So good to have the option of taking control of your own health and being able to access treatments not widely available on the NHS due to cost. Would have appreciated more feedback from the prescribing doctor, but I presume they only do this where necessary. Will be using again."
6223	6223	"Needed ASAP antibiotic cream, which, let be honest, gp' s don't consider needed to prescribe, and in 2 days my DAUGHTER,  got better. So thank u onlineclinic for saving us."
6224	6224	"No complaints at all, aside from the price!That said, if you want a quick fix look no further."
6225	6225	"Excellent, fast efficient service when you can't get an immediate appointment at your Doctors"
6226	6226	"Comprehensive health questionnaire, fast diagnosis, kept well informed of progress of diagnosis and extremely fast dispatch of prescription!Will certainly use again and won't hesitate to recommend this company."
6227	6227	Excellent service with helpful staff. Prescription delivered next dayHighly recommended
6228	6228	Very happy with this service. It was very prompt and efficient .
6229	6229	A very professional service with a very quick response bact to me. Delivery time was exactly as quoted. I would definitely recommend the online clinic
6230	6230	Obviously a speedy service with minimal impact on my working week. The main thing was I felt confident using the service due to questions asked before treatment was offered and also advice given was sensible. I had been suffering for several weeks and would have had to wait further for a doctors appointment but this speedy response has meant a week later I feel 100% better.
6231	6231	Excellent service all round.
6232	6232	Good service quick
6233	6233	A reliable and responsible service. Discreet and efficient.
6234	6234	Was a quick service.
6235	6235	"Website is easy to use, service is what it says on the tin......  but automatic use of Post Office Special Delivery is expensive and not always really justified. In many  cases,  cheaper ""signed for"" deivery is perfectly satisfactory.... and customers would appreciate the resulting lower cost."
6236	6236	I got online review decision and delivery in record time making excellent progress 100% more confidence with meducation results most proffessional
6237	6237	Excellent service but  expensive!
6238	6238	Was quick and very reasonable support. Pain gone and is no more swallow!Many thanksRegardsAnna
6239	6239	Very good choice. Thorough in their questioning and really fast service A little expensive but good when given a discount.
6240	6240	Was able to get a quick service and medicine delivery was quick too.
6241	6241	I have made 2 orders now and the medication is 100% authentic. The staff go out of their way in terms of customer service and are very helpful. You can only feel safe in their hands. Thank you
6242	6242	"Fast and efficient service that enabled me to get my antibiotics without leaving the house. The antibiotics box came with the doctor's guidance on it, so I was never confused about how to take my pills. Despite the fact it's a bit expensive, I would definitely recommend this service. Worth every penny."
6243	6243	Quick delivery and response time
6244	6244	Quick and speedy service - great :)
6245	6245	"I was really pleased with the outcome of my consultation as I was able to get access to the appropriate medicine without needing to see a GP. I know full well what is needed to sort out my skin irritation that flares up from time to time.Due to working around the clock and not being easily available to attend the doctors, it was so refreshing to have a fast procedure at the touch of a button. I will definitely use the service again."
6246	6246	Very satisfied with the service and speedy delivery
6247	6247	"Fantastic service, fantastic support, very reliable."
6248	6248	"Fast online service, incredibly fast delivery.Can't fault it."
6249	6249	Fast Delivery
6250	6250	It's a quick easy  service also next day delivery
6251	6251	"Would highly recomend the clinic, for drugs that due to NICE guidelines no longer seem available on the NHS. Prompt, efficient  and discreet service."
6252	6252	Bought antibiotics as I could not get to a dentist. The online consultation was thorough and delivery was swift.
6253	6253	"Recently ordered Victoza after having a consultation. Can't comment too much yet on how effective these pens are as it is still early days. However, I am very pleased with the prompt service and continuous e-mails underlining implications from taking Victoza and how to prevent."
6254	6254	"After being told I'd have to wait 72 hours for an NHS appointment for an obvious chest infection, and then spend half the day waiting with no guarantee of treatment, I decided to try this service. Impressed that what I thought might be dodgy was well run with detailed questions and checks; and the next day special delivery worked very well. Even before the date of the first possible NHS appointment, I was pretty much better. No problems."
6255	6255	"As above, very good and professional customer service."
6256	6256	Can't thank online clinic enough - didn't realise help was available in such a efficient way.  Excellent service for those needing prompt doctor/dentist treatment without having to wait for an appointment.  Would recommend to anyone and would certainly use again myself if needed.  Offered a choice of medication and was able to read information on each before selecting the one best suited for me.
6257	6257	"Very prompt in replying, took all relevant details and quick to deliver the correct medication that helped me a lot"
6258	6258	"Very pleased with the swift service, I am now out of pain"
6259	6259	GREAT????????????????????????????????
6260	6260	"Far more satisfactory service than that offered by my GP. A correct diagnosis was made and I was able to purchase the correct medication and dosage that works for me. After weeks of suffering under the NHS, the online clinic provided the right treatment. Have made a complete recovery. Would not hesitate to use this company again. Swift, professional and convenient service."
6261	6261	Fine prompt customer service satisfaction
6262	6262	The online clinic provide a very good service.fast n discreet
6263	6263	My precription was dispatched and delivered fast.
6264	6264	Ok more expensive than getting a prescription from the doctor or dentist but the time saving is huge and if your dentist is on holiday like mine was this is ideal to get the medication so quickly without having to go to somewhere new. Medication is genuine and exactly as you would get from the local pharmacy with a prescription. Thanks.
6265	6265	A good service
6266	6266	A fabulous find of a company. Fast and reliable delivery. The online clinic put the patient first.
6267	6267	"Service was quick, from prescription to delivery. Medication arrived in perfect order. Would be more than happy to use again. Great when you can't get to the doctors! :)"
6268	6268	"The site and online form filling was not too onerous, in fact it inspired confidence that you are dealing with a genuine and efficient company. The cost being the only criticism as it was more than I had expected to pay, but as surgeries as very reluctant to issue antibiotics these days there is little choice. I felt my responses were being monitored by a doctor or pharmacist and I had no doubt that I would have been referred to my doctor if necessary. Recommended."
6269	6269	Brilliant company did exactly what they said they would do and sent my medication on time and iv had no ill effects what so ever in fact it helped me a great deal excellent service
6270	6270	Probably how things should be done more generally in the NHS. Prohibitively expensive for me personally. Pleased overall
6271	6271	"Immediate response, professional info and support, next day delivery."
6272	6272	Highly recommend to anyone!  Great pricesGreat customer service Super fast delivery No queues! Just fast and prompt service!
6273	6273	"Absolutely top service! Online questionnaire is very detailed and honestly felt like I've just been seen by my GP. The drugs been delivered the next day, so I could start my treatment right away. I could not be more thankful for the excellent service."
6274	6274	This offers a superb service and allows customers access to their usual medication when they need it immediately Particularly helpful when you have a recurring condition and don't want to wait a week for a doctor's appointment or a repeat prescription which also takes a week.
6275	6275	The order turned up next day. No hassle. Fully effective product.
6276	6276	I don't usually write reviews but I often read them myself before I make a decision about  parting with my money. The Online Clinic have provided me with a competent honest service that I would not hesitate to use again. The online prescription questions are what you would expect from a professional pharmacy and I felt just as though I was seeing a doctor.The speed of the delivery I'd give 10 out of 10 . Lets face it the speed at which your prescription arrives with you is of course of upmost importance when you are unwell. All in all a first class service :)
6277	6277	Fast and reliable
6278	6278	good and extremely fast service
6279	6279	"The website was easy to navigate, the result of my online consultation was swift and my medication arrived promptly."
6280	6280	"This is the first time I have ordered with the online clinic and I have been very happy with they're service, they are very prompt and efficient. Will defiantly order from them again."
6281	6281	I don't always get time to visit my own GP due to work commitments.  With this service it was quick and easy and didn't take much time!! I registered and put forward what I needed.  It didn't take long for them to get back to me. My script was sorted and delivered next day just as they stayed it would be. Excellent service.
6282	6282	"Contacted them late, Thursday afternoon, was given a choice of medication which arrived on my doorstep much to my relief on Saturday morning."
6283	6283	Very prompt very easy to use and good value for money
6284	6284	Easy good service
6285	6285	Can thoroughly recommend 'The Online Clinic'.My item was delivered very quickly; and even though it was a little bit expensive - it was worth it for the convenience.
6286	6286	Thank you for providing such a prompt and efficient service done in a most professional manner. All questions asked of me were totally relevant and gave me confidence I was dealing with an AI company.y
6287	6287	Ordered some antibiotic cream and it arrived when expected. Happy customer.
6288	6288	"It's a brilliant service when you don't have the time or can't get an appointment with your GP, which sadly seems to be becoming more of a problem.  I would really appreciated your help and I will definitely return in the future"
6289	6289	Good service and quick would use again definitely
6290	6290	"Very professional and excellent service. So much more convent than the waiting times to see my own GP. Highly recommended, trustworthy and extremely quick service. Thank you so much for your help. I will be recommending this to both family and friends who have any medical complaints"
6291	6291	was great quick easy and also trustworthy sorted out my chest infection and delivered to my business.
6292	6292	Very simple way to get hold of a specific product that I had been searching for.
6293	6293	Having this option to order of the website is so convenient because of my busy work schedule and the amount of hours that I work.
6294	6294	very good would use again
6295	6295	"Very professional, prompt and efficient service. Would definitely recommend."
6296	6296	I found this service quick easy and would reccomend highly
6297	6297	Highly recommend! Fantastic service!
6298	6298	"I've used the online clinic twice,and all i can say is i was extremely happy with the service i was provided with,next day delivery as well,i wouldn't use any other company.I would highly recommend this company to anyone."
6299	6299	super fast thanks
6300	6300	The online clinic is a professional trusted service with prompt responses and delivery.
6301	6301	"5 Star - A fast, efficient and personalised service"
6302	6302	"Had my doubts about using service, but found it quick and easy - Dr (?) reviewed problem  (internally via the web.... ?) in about 10 minutes and was 'allowed' medication (to buy) to solve the problem.  Obviously charges for the medication is extortionate - but if you need a quick, easy, private, no fuss solution then - worth it.  Would use again."
6303	6303	I really do not have time to get to the doctors even supposing I could get an appointment. I had a good idea what was wrong with me and when I did the online consultation the doctor agreed. I had antibiotics the next day.
6304	6304	"Thank you so much for your excellent service - it was thorough and professional. Unfortunately I suffer a lot from middle ear infections - and this meant I could get prescribed the relevant antibiotics, quickly, efficiently and without bothering my GP or relying on prescriptions.Thank you kindly,Mr. Lawrence"
6305	6305	I found the clinic to be much more convenient than waiting forever for my GP. They were thorough and made sure i got the medicine my GP  would have prescribed
6306	6306	"Online examination by doctor and production of prescription cut out the ""paper prescription by post"" inconvenience that I have experienced with other providers. Promise to keep my GP informed of any medications supplied reassures me that the prescription has full medical oversight."
6307	6307	.Fast and efficient service. Highly recommended
6308	6308	A prompt and considered professional service that really worked for me
6309	6309	As normal couldn't get an appointment at the dentist so when I suddenly found myself with an absess on line clinic were quick and efficient at sending out penicillin so I could start feeling better soon.
6310	6310	Can't ask for better. Very quick response and item was delivered next day
6311	6311	"Having used this company on several occasions, I can honestly advocate anyone using their service, as they offer free advice on matters medical, thus resulting on the right medication for you as an individual.Plus, the despatch of your required medicine arriving usually within 24 hours of placing the order, so in a word excellent."
6312	6312	"great easy service, hesitant at first like everyone, massively convenient and reliable though, genuine products, definitely use this service again!"
6313	6313	very fast service I have seen so far
6314	6314	I work away from home quite a lot so sometimes don't get to see my GP as soon as I'd like. This is perfect. Great service. Everything turned up when they said it would. I'd definitely use this company again.
6315	6315	Great service
6316	6316	I contacted the company concerned that it was a scam or that I would receive fake pharmaceuticals. I couldn't have been more wrong. A pharmacist reviewed my order within 30 mins and I was then able to order and receive free next day delivery. I then contacted the company by phone and spoke to a representative about the packaging who was very professional.The prices are slightly higher than other websites; but the overall experience and reassurance you get from the quality of service outweighs saving a few pounds. Highly recommended and will be ordering again soon.CraigGlasgow
6317	6317	I found the service very efficient.  Apposite questions were asked of me and the decision to supply the cream I wanted was made rapidly. The cream arrived quickly and has proved to be very effective. Thank you for your service.
6318	6318	"When you go online for any product or service, you never know what you are going to get but I have found the Online Clinic information to tell me exactly what I needed to know, the service quick and efficient, the product to be what it said it was and the cost to be reasonable. I will return when necessary."
6319	6319	Very good service and fast delivery
6320	6320	I got it sorted n one day with delivery.
6321	6321	Order arrived on day stated.very satisfied.
6322	6322	I ordered my medicine online after a quick consultation and it arrived next day. Fantastic
6323	6323	"Very straight forward and efficient service, common sense approach. Thankyou!"
6324	6324	First time I have ever used online for meds This was a great service  and will use again and recommend.
6325	6325	I had a dental abscess but no dentist. The Online Clinic were excellent in prescribing just what I needed while I sought a dentist.
6326	6326	I have used The Online Clinic on a few occasions now and can honestly say they are very efficient and I would  highly recommend their services.
6327	6327	quick and easy site to use and so helpful and keep you up to date about your order
6328	6328	Great service. Prompt delivery. I would definitely use this site again.
6329	6329	"Very good service, quick delivery! After submitting my problem the doctors replied with a medicine to help the problem in less the 30 min! The medicine helped clear the problem! I would use this Service again and again! Thanks!"
6330	6330	"I recently ordered a prescription that wasn't shipped for 6 days, by which time I had actually moved home and couldn't receive it. Not so great.However, every other time I have ordered it has arrived within the allocated time. You win some, you lose some!"
6331	6331	"I ordered a test from The Online Clinic and It's been my first time. It was nice and quick, I would recomend it to my friends.  Thank you."
6332	6332	"The registration and order process was pretty painless, but the next day delivery didn't materialise and I'm still waiting 11 days later.To be fair they have said there were issues with their automated dispensing robot (or something like that) and they have emailed frequent apologies and we all know what happens when the computer says no.I did feel a bit sorry for them, but what did surprise me was the lack of a mention of this on their website unless I'm the only one it's affecting. I'm also quite surprised no-one has mentioned it here before.Can't really comment on the quality of the medicine as I'm still waiting..."
6333	6333	The consultation was fast and offered different types of antibiotics i could choose from for my problem. My gp never allows this as they will only use first line treatments. After trying them in the past i knew which ones worked for me so i ordered them and got next day delivery. It was faster than trying to see my gp and having to wait for a prescription.
6334	6334	"Very professional, I could not get appointment at my dentist and was suffering with a dental abcess. The online clinic GP assessed my case thoroughly and prompltly, I recieved the prescribed medication the next day. I cannot fault this service - excellent, professional, safe and fast!"
6335	6335	i not shure that work i used just one month.
6336	6336	Used this online pharmacy and they were fantastic speedy delivery and a one to one consultation. .will definitely use them again
6337	6337	"Fast, reliable and accurate medical advice"
6338	6338	Very professional and swift service
6339	6339	"Fast efficient service , tablets delivered next day . Would recommend online clinic to anyone."
6340	6340	"Best choice I ever made. Trustworthy,  reliable,  great communication and quick service. I highly recommend using the online clinic to everyone.  I can't thank the staff enough for their great work."
6341	6341	I knew what I wanted and this was prescribed.  My existing medication had clearly been reviewed as some advice on when to take it was given.  I was pleased to receive my medication the following day.  It was a quick and easy service to use.
6342	6342	I found online doctor to be very efficient and professional at all times.  Any queries are always answered very quickly.  I would thoroughly recommend them to anyone.
6343	6343	I was ill while travelling about the UK and Europe and did not have time to go and see my traditional GP and used The Online Clinic for the first time.Information needed and processing of my request took about 15 minutes and it was a Friday but my prescription still arrived Saturday even though it was supposed to be Monday which was great.If in need again I would use this service without hesitation.
6344	6344	It has got to be 5 stars for this website. They did everything that they said they would do. Swift response form the doctor. Next day delivery. Professional follow-up e-mail to make sure that the medication worked and I had no side effects. I will use them again and have already recommended The Online Clinic to a work colleague.
6345	6345	Helpful website.  Delivered my medication promptly.
6346	6346	I was very happy with the service I received from the online clinic received parcel next day as promised would order from this company again only problem I found was that I didn't know how many I was allowed to order at the same time.
6347	6347	"It was a problem-free process to answer the medical questionnaire and get an approval and prescription suggestion from a practitioner. Fast and easy way when you cannot afford to loose a working day to see your GP or when they are too busy to give a reasonable appointment.Downsides were: the medication is massively overpriced (for me it was five and a half times more expensive - although that included postage). Plus, because the parcel came as signed for, I could not get my tablets before the weekend - people who are working during the day are not at home to sign for a parcel either.All in all: great, fast, professional but massively overpriced service. I sill might have to use it again, if the push comes to shove."
6348	6348	"Excellent service with quality customer care.Items dispatched promptly,link supplied for product usage and dosage.Reminder sent for repeat prescription.the website is user friendly. Would have no hesitation in using this company again."
6349	6349	"I used this site due to my sister visiting me in the UK and she suffers with a skin condition that flared up . She is not comfortable going to doctors so this was great that we could consult privately with a professional . And they were very thoughtful and professional through the whole process . We did check other online doctors sites but by far this was the best and also the pricing is the fairest and best value for money as the prescription fee includes your consultation . In addition the prescription arrived  next day .. We will definitely use them again . Also look out for their extra promotions they have online for discounts , really worth it"
6350	6350	I found this website easy to use they were past and prompt with their decision from the doctor and the prescription arrived the very next day I would highly recommend this service to anyone and would definitely use them again if needed

6376	6376	"Ordering through The Online Clinic was a simple, streamlined and efficient process. After my order was confirmed I received notification that the item I had ordered had unexpectedly run out of stock and would be delivered a day later than expected. I was offered a discount on my next order as compensation which was great and I would definitely recommend The Online Clinic."

6381	6381	"Love love love the site. The only thing I would love to see is s secondary address for delivery.A signature is required,  so hard if you are not home. Fortunately I was able to go and pick up my antibiotics at my main post office later that night."

6383	6383	"I ordered some antibiotics for a tooth infection (could only get a dental appointment in several days). Drugs arrived next day, fantastic! Saved me from getting a lot worse before I could see the dentist."
6384	6384	The clinic was very thorough with its assessment and efficient in getting the prescribed medication to me.A very good service.
6385	6385	Excellent service from start to finish and I also feel alot better after the help from the clinic.
6386	6386	"Second time I have used this site. I ordered one day, late in the evening, and ended up speaking to a Doctor that just happened to still be there. After talking my symptoms through with him, my medication was despatched within 15 minutes and I received it the next day. Wonderful service and medication worked!! Cannot praise it highly enough."
6387	6387	I have used this service when I have been too busy at work to visit GP. Would recommend this site- prompt and slick service.
6388	6388	"I don't necessarily not have time to visit the gp nor do they give appointments weeks later. I do however have issues communicating fully with them as they are not very warm and friendly, certainly not the place to discuss intimate problems. So I was pleasantly surprised by this service and evenmore so since I only paid if given treatment. The price was reasonable and I received the following day. I will be using again since I negates the need to visit the gp and is as simple as 1-2-3!"
6389	6389	Excellent service and dispatch After calling my GP waiting 3 to be told no appointments for a week I felt rough and knew exactly what i needed so was more than happy to  use this service Very reasonable price and when you are really feeling not well i can assure youbyou are more than happy to pay for the products you know you need to get you better

6392	6392	"I was struggling with a misdiagnosed fungal infection for nearly a year, when I decided for a second opinion so I visited the online clinic where I spoke with a doctor who asked me for more details and a photo of the affected skin. The doctor spot on said it didn't seem to be a fungal infection and prescribed me a steroid, I used if for less than a week and the rash on mi skin vanished!  I'm so grateful!"
6393	6393	Was very efficient and quick and exactly what you need when feeling unwell.
6394	6394	"Speedy and professional response, prescribed antibiotics arrived by special delivery. Good service if a tad expensive"

6396	6396	Thank you!!!!
6397	6397	"I was prescribed some antibiotics from my dentist for an absess on my tooth but after the 5 day course it hadn't cleared up so I ordered some from the online clinic and they were very good first with the online consultation and then with immediate despatch so I didn't have a break between the 2  and thankfully it worked a treat, really good service"
6398	6398	Found this online service for the antibiotics I urgently needed for an infection - ordered them just before 4pm and they arrived the next morning.  My online diagnosis was fast and efficient and after a 7 day course of treatment I have fully recovered.  Had I gone to my own NHS doctor it would have taken 3-4 days for me to receive the anti-biotics I needed from him and by then my infection could have spread further. I would use this online service again and again without any hesitancy.  The anti-biotics I paid for were a bit expensive but it was well worth it to get the treatment so quickly.
6399	6399	great service an fast
6400	6400	The title says it all. Was very impressed that my request was considered and actioned over a weekend. Not quite sure I needed the large size version of the item received. The NHS has supplied a much smaller size in the past. But I doubt that affected the all-in price I paid that much.
6401	6401	"Very professional and prompt service, I will certainly use again and have already recommended to others."
6402	6402	"Professional, efficient, confidential service, I especially found staff helpful and competent when I rang with a query. Will definitely use this company again."
6403	6403	Very professional website with quick response and delivery. Very much recommended and will use again if needed.
6404	6404	"Excellent service, Prompt response, fast delivery"
6405	6405	This service was very quick.very happy with the service.as I live quite a distance from my doctors and due to work shifts its really awkward for me to see my GP.so this service suits me great and very happy overall.
6406	6406	"Fast,easy to use and really saved me from weeks of constant pain and suffering while pregnant and awaiting treatment thank you so very much"
6407	6407	Couldnt recommend this company highly enough. Very attentive staff who didn't cut corners - making sure everything was done efficiently and to the appropriate high standards. The doctor was extremely quick with his response and my order arrived the next day. Would definitely use again.
6408	6408	"I was feeling bad with an abscess and not looking forward to the weekend and beyond taking painkillers. Fast service and on the mend feeling a whole lot better thanks to the online consultation and speedy delivery of my prescription, Thank You so much"

Rather than trying to get an appointment with the local GP and be fobbed off with some junior doctor i can't understand, or who can't understand or ignores what i am trying to tell them i gave the online clinic a go.Signed up. Gave symptoms. Got prescrition. Ordered meds. Came next day."
6413	6413	"From start to finish very professional,delivery on the date stated would highly recommend..."

6416	6416	Great service from this company very helpful and next day delivery I will certainly order from them again
6417	6417	I had a dental infection and couldn't get to the dentist. I was able to order antibiotics that arrived within 2 days and settled things down within 2-3 days. The drugs are a little pricey - that is my only reservation.
6418	6418	I was listened to and felt supported by a professional Dr. The service was prompt.
6419	6419	I found this service very easy to use and extremely convenient.... Beats a trip to the GP and didn't have to wait long for my prescription... Definitely recommended and will use this service again....
6420	6420	Very pleased with service. Kept me informed at all times

6430	6430	"fast replies,i have found the services offered to be of great value, better than waiting days to get a doctors appointment in my area, very satisfied customer, would highly recommend,"
6431	6431	Straight forward and very efficient system. Reassuring and good service.
6432	6432	I found this company so easy to use and my medication came the next day with no fuss by special delivery. I was in a lot of pain which came in around 11.30 at night time and there was a doctor availble to assist me and help me through the process. Would highly recommend
6433	6433	This was a very easy process. The medication I ordered came the next day in fantastic 'keep cool' packaging. Everything appears to be completely up front with delivery from a UK pharmacy.
6434	6434	"My face swelled up and I was in agony, tooth abscess ! I wasn't able to get a dental appointment for 2 weeks, I was managing the pain with pain killers until one night I woke in agony ! I could have gone to the hospital and had the usual long wait . However I went online to see if there was anything I could do from home,I stumbled across the online clinic and was expecting it to be some sort of scam, I couldn't have Been more wrong! They were excellent I was diagnosed and antibiotics on there way to me within ten minutes, they arrived the next day!  I went to the dentist and because my abscess had gone he was able to treat me straight away instead of having to get antibiotics and wait. I cannot speak highly enough of the service I received !

6451	6451	Needed antibiotics quickly - I knew what the problem was. Couldn't get a dentist appointment. Got a prescription approved in a matter of a few minutes ( late in the evening ). Dispatched next day - problem solved!
6452	6452	I am not one too write a review but I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and amazed at how quick and reliable the online clinic has been. After having had bumps on the back of my nape area for a bit I tried going too find out what was wrong at my local Gp (after booking an appointment in advance and waiting for a couple weeks now) only to get the right prescription for the wrong amount of time and my local Gp did not actually inform me what this actually was (turned out too be folliculitis) after trying too find alternatives online I tried this and literally within a couple hours of signing up and describing my issue I had been told exactly what it could be how long it should take to clear it and preventative measures too stop it from coming back in less than 4 hours I was and I still am impressed anyone being a bit sceptical I thoroughly advice you to try them out delivery of your prescription arrives the next day and even though I thought the prices were a bit high I understand that it's still the cheapest you can ever find for a private clinic
6453	6453	"I have experienced the symptoms before, but had started a new job so could not get to my gp - this service was a godsend as I got approved, and the articles dispatched quickly and efficiently."
6454	6454	It was quick easy and next day delivery product was brilliant . Thank you so much

6457	6457	"My first experience of The Online Clinic was of a prompt, no fuss, efficient service which was also conscientious and thorough.The delivery arrived as promised with clear instructions.  I would recommend this service and would use it again should need arise."
6458	6458	"Received my product the next again day and it worked wonders, thank you so much"
6459	6459	"The online clinic service was very good. Fast, efficient and I would recommend."
6460	6460	"Great and easy to order, came on time as well"
6461	6461	"I was a bit hesitant about ordering online but my experience with The Online Clinic has completely changed that!  It was a completely hassle free experience and the delivery was extremely prompt.  I will definitely be using their service again and cannot speak highly enough about the service that I received.  On top of that the value for money for the items ordered was, in my opinion, very good.  There were no hidden costs and the total included the price of the medication plus the Prescribing Doctor's consultation form review.  I think the fact that I fully intend to use them again is a testament to the trust that I have for The Online Clinic.  Thank you for such a professional, yet warm and friendly service."
6462	6462	"I can recommend the service of The Online.Swift, fast and courteous Service."
6463	6463	Quick service with extremely fast delivery. Would not hesitate to use again
6464	6464	"I needed some antibiotics for a infection I had and couldn't get an appointment so see someone about it until the following week. The infection was getting worse so I decided to try the online clinic,  I was dubious at first because I've never had an on line medical consultation or bought/ been prescribed medication on line before. However I received my prescription which was delivered to my workplace for me the very next day and the infection was controlled thanks to using this service. I would recommend it to anyone, yes you pay more for your prescription as it's not NHS funded but I think it's reasonable and I found it worth the cost."
6465	6465	Was very satisfied with the service .Will most definitely use this service again
6466	6466	Cannot fault ordering or delivery
6467	6467	Extremely convenient and takes away the waiting for a doctor's appointment and then messing around with chemists..Yes it does cost more but can't fault the ease and speed
6468	6468	Very helpfull

6475	6475	"Amazing service, and very fast delivery.  Will use again for sure."
6476	6476	Very helpful  and quick with orders
6477	6477	Quick delivery would use again
6478	6478	I used the clinic to diagnose and prescribe for fungal toe nail infection. They were prompt and efficient. Medication was prescribed and delivered the next day. Saves time booking a GP appointment for a minor ailment that would have involved taking time off work. The cost worked out at under 50p per day of medication. Recommended.
6479	6479	"The process to get my prescription filled was streamlined, simple, quick and methodical - the website is easy to understand and follow - communication from the online clinic was also prompt"
6480	6480	"as above but expensive, gave me a call back, can't say better than that."
6481	6481	having used this service before i was in no doubt that i would receive my order promply so was  not surprised to have deliverywithin 24 hours.Thank you On Line Clinic.
6482	6482	I was very pleased with the service offered and will 100% use again.
6483	6483	"The online questionnaire was very in depth to find exactly what I needed and my order was dealt with promptly, very good service, would definatly use them again"
6484	6484	I had a gum abscess and after a few simple questions was prescribed antibiotics that were delivered next day.  Excellent!
6485	6485	Fast and professional.
6486	6486	Wonderful service for people who need medication promptly
6487	6487	I had very pleasent experience with the Online Clinic. I`v got fast answers to all my questions and the order was delivered in time. Very convenient.
6488	6488	"Good, quick service, highly recommend!!"
6489	6489	Quick presciption service and delivery of well known quality products
6490	6490	"I was a little nervous ordering such pricey medication online, but found the service offered to be efficient and very professional. I had a mild adverse reaction to using the drug in the beginning, and was given good advice in a personal fashion which proved correct and resolved the problem. I'd definitelyrecommend this service."
6491	6491	I felt the antibiotics were very expensive priced at ?39.95. Its more than 4 times the price of a prescription so its exploiting people who require urgent meds. The service was quick efficient and the website worked well though with a very quick decision made.
6492	6492	I was amazed at how straightforward it was to get the meds I needed. It certainly was better than having to wait 3 or 4 weeks for a GP appointment. The medications are genuine which is always a concern.I would certainly use the online clinic again.
6493	6493	Very prompt service would use this site again.
6494	6494	"Excellent service, very quick response! Appreciate the number of options in medication provided as well.  Will absolutely use again and have already recommended it to friends."
6495	6495	"The on-line clinic is a fast and efficient means of obtaining medical treatment for uncomplicated health conditions, when seeing a healthcare professional is not immediately available (as is often the case these days with long waiting times for appointments). I found the service to be simple to access, and, following a short questionnaire which is used to assess your condition, the treatment (one from a choice of 4 in my case) is sent to you. My only problem was that as the medication was sent registered mail, I was out when it should have been delivered, and could not get to the sorting office for 4 days to collect - by which time I could have got to the Dentist and got the medication for 5 times less; and not had to suffer days more pain! I also had this horrible thought that such s service is open to abuse by those who are may be 'addicated' to medications or are hypochondriacs (with plenty of spare cash). Anyway, I guess that is their issue! Overall, a fast and efficient service which (with reservations) has its place in the range of healthcare options now available to service users.M.S."
6496	6496	"Fast,  easy  to use, great  if  you have  an idea of  what is wrong with you  but don't have time to  go to the doctors."
6497	6497	"Service that I received was excellent,I am a very busy person as I run and skipper a fishing vessel and work very unsociable hours and can't just stop everything and run to the doctors with minor ailments.Find this company a big help and very professional ."
6498	6498	My experience was very good and commendable by the online clinic team. It was confidential prompt and reliable . Well done
6499	6499	"Great, fast and efficient service"
6500	6500	The service was efficient & prompt so I have been very happy with this service.
6501	6501	Quick delivery and great customer service. Highly recommend.
6502	6502	"Despite applying on a weekend the response was rapid, detailed and very helpful!"
6503	6503	I was extremely pleased with the way The Staff on the On line clinic looked after me'  My medication arrived at my home quickly. I will definitely use them again.

The medication is supporting my weight loss programme and I will be returning for a repeat prescription in the next few weeks."
6507	6507	I guess that the reason the service is expensive is that a Doctor is required to review one's health data.I was impressed by the speed that my drugs were delivered. Faster than my usual pharmacy delivers!

6514	6514	A great service when I got nowhere with the nhs . Will be using again when I'm in need .
6515	6515	"So impressed with the service. Was really worried about buying antibiotics online but read some reviews and went for it. Initially was given the choice of two different treatments, neither of which i had used before, so i contacted the clinic to request antibiotics that i had used before. In no time at all i had my request accepted, a prescription issued, and the tablets sent. All in a very short space of time. I am so impressed i have already recommended this clinic to someone that needed treatment asap."
6516	6516	"I would like to say I am very pleased with the service the online clinic provided. They are professional, efficient and above all helpful. I will request their services again if need be."
6517	6517	"I have struggled desperately with my weight my entire life. I had had enough of trying to get answers and help from my GP. I felt completely hopeless after being let down time and again. I found the online clinic, filled out the consultation on a weekend and was responded to on the same day with actual options. I was prescribed Victoza and ordered it that week. The package came quickly (despite being a bank holiday weekend) and was professionally packaged and discreet. Unfortunately the novo fine needles were missing from the package but it just took a quick phone call to the clinic and they were sent out to me the following day. No fuss. It's been just over a week since starting my medication and I have already lost several pounds and I am hopeful once again. Overall the service was very professional, prompt and discreet and I have had a very good experience and would recommend to friends and family."
6518	6518	Prescription was processed straight away. Medication arrived promptly.
6519	6519	Quick service that helped me get back on my feet quickly until I am able to get registered with a doctor
6520	6520	"Living ""in the sticks"" I find getting to my GP difficult, and getting something as simple as a course of antibiotics for a rapid onset UTI impossible as, even if a get the prescription I then have another journey to a dispensing Pharmacy. I am no youngster and, have experienced the condition quite a few times before so know when I really do need the treatment.The next day delivery by the Online Clinic was a Godsend, although not cheap, well worth the money.I am hopeful that I will not have to call on them again too soon but would not hesitate to do so if the need arises."
6521	6521	Fast efficient service
6522	6522	There is nothing negative to say but just praise - my order was done and delivery was ontime
6523	6523	Excellent service and product to boot.
6524	6524	I found the on line service very professional and promt in reviewing my order. It does what it says on the tin!
6525	6525	thank you for such a quick response when I had really awful tooth pain - your service helped me get over the worst until I could see dentist
6526	6526	"Having recieved my prescription the next day, I cannot commend you're company highly enough! Excellent professional service throughout!! Would not hesitate to use The Online Clinic in the future and will recommend to everyone i know. Many thanks for you're help. G. Hughes."

6529	6529	"I had a chest infection and I wanted consultation fast, my GP had no appointment for the next 5 days. I went on theonlineclinic for antibiotic and they diagnosed me accurately and correctly. The whole process was fast and got my proscription the next day after approval. Thank you"
6530	6530	"Great service, very fast"
6531	6531	"I'd like to thank the staff at the Online Clinic for paying attention to my needs - I feel they actually read through my enhanced application to try to help and support, yet not cure, a long term Erectile Disfunction problem I've had for many years. I had a slight 'technical error' when submitting my application, which took well over an hour to complete. The lady is spoke to at the customer services was very helpful and advised that one of the Doctors would look into my application when next available, as she was unable to put me through to speak to a doctor as it was just about closing time for the clinic. Within 15 minutes, I received an email advising my application was successful and a prescription had been authorised. I don't think I've ever received such prompt and fast customer service - so I'd personally like to thank both the staff members involved in my enquiry when I called the Online Clinic for assistance. The medication prescribed is in one word - wonderful. It does exactly why I'd hoped and wished for - and even more!  My confidence and the relationship between me and my long term partner has genuinely significantly improved thanks to the Online Clinic. So I'd give 6 stars if I could for my overall experience. Fantastic service, amazing prescribed medication and a very happy customer who would recommend the Online Clinic (which I am doing already) to friends and more. Thanks again. Warmest regardsPaul Henshaw"
6532	6532	"I was recommended to the Online Clinic by a friend and I am very glad that I took her advice. The service was swift, professional with my prescription item in my hands within 48 hours. The item prescribed has also helped a lot. I would have no hesitation dealing with the clinic again or recommending others to do so."
6533	6533	"This site is very good, honest genuine site, very pleased, will definitely return."
6534	6534	"The service is great, allowed me to get a prescription my doctor couldn't prescribe yet, and it was fast delivery. However I feel to improve the service a little more support such as diet & exercise plans, or just verbal support along with the weight loss medications would go a long way for patients."
6535	6535	Fast and reliable service. Will be recommending to family and friends.
6536	6536	I could not fault this service. Very professional fast service. If I hadn't used this service I would have ended up in A and E as I could not get a doctor's appointment for something as simple as a tooth abscess that only required antibiotics.
6537	6537	"Excellent,review completed within 2 hours, treatment despatched same day."
6538	6538	I had a bad dental abscess that had caused extreme swelling in my face and neck (upper pre molar tooth). The online clinic was able to prescribe antibiotics that brought the swelling down greatly and allowed the tooth to be removed by the dentist successfully last week.I ordered at 2pm on a Thursday and had the product shortly after 9am on the Friday. Such excellent and rapid delivery cannot be faulted. 5 stars.
6539	6539	"Had an abcess on tooth dentist couldn't see me as away, prescribed antibiotics thankfully as this greatly helped me until I was seen. Great service fast delivery and a life saver!"
6540	6540	Very fast delivery which is good when u need medication would use again no problem happy puppy
6541	6541	I would've had to wait 2-3 weeks to see my GP so I thought I'd try an online service. The reviews for the online clinic were positive and I was pleasantly surprised. My experience was consistent with the reviews. The service is efficient and professional.
6542	6542	"Buying medication on line is fraught with risk, rip-offs, cons, and data protection.I was lucky with my first attempt, I chose ""The Online Clinic"", a good web site, easy to navigate, with plenty of direct communication options if needed.The product delivery was exceptional as was the packaging.to describe this service in a word ""professional""."
6543	6543	Brilliant fast effective delivery. Discrete also. Am having fantastic results as we speak and I can only hope more people feel the way I am feeling at this moment in time. May the results continue!

6552	6552	The Online Clinic was recommended to me by a friend. I was looking for Viagra or sildenafil at a reasonable price but wanted to use a UK website that was trustworthy. Everything went smoothly and my package arrived the next day as promised. The products are genuine and reasonable priced.
6553	6553	"Searching the www for the essential travel kit for foreseeable medical emergencies in remote locations, the Onlineclinic provided a speedy economical solution. Postal delivery worked well."
6554	6554	The staff were very helpful and fulfilled my order with prompt attention. I would recommend this company to everyone.
6555	6555	Your supply of your prescription medication includes a medical consultation and taking into consideration the cost of seeing a clinician face-to-face this option is considerably cheaper.
6556	6556	"The Online Clinic is a really great website. My doctor recommended a medication but he said he could not prescribe it for me on the NHS but recommeded this online service as they had helped one of his other patients. The team at The Online Clinic could not have been more helpful. After a quick but reasuringly thorough consultation, one of the doctors prescribed the Liraglutide that I needed and it was with me at 8 am the next day. I will definitely use this clinic again and would recommend them to anyone."

6558	6558	I found this service really easy to use and felt that the issuing of my  prescription was professionally done .

6594	6594	The first time I used this service i was more than satisfied I received a good long course of antibiotics. But this time for the same problem I only received 6 re tablets which I don't feel was as effective. And so in effect I paid ?29.99 for 6 tablets.

I did, and was approved for the treatment I needed. I used the cream very wearily as I had to be as it was from an online  service, and we hear a lot of bad things about how not to use online medical services as the medication may not be all it is supposed to be.I used the cream carefully, felt a bit of sensation and waited, by the afternoon, my face has started to clear up ad by the next day remarkable difference and the rash had started to improve greatly.

I cannot think of a single thing that they need to do to improve the service. I will definitely be back for more treatment when I run out.
6717	6717	Quick service. Doctor had reviewed my submission within a few hours and my medication arrived 2 days later. The medication was quite expensive compared to normal GP costs but I guess that's the price you pay for the convenience of it.

The doctors also stated that they didnt deal with dental therefore I was in alot of pain with nowhere to turn . I found this site where I had to fill in a comprehensive medical questionnaire and this was then reviewed by a qualified doctor . My antibiotics were then paid for and delivered next day to enable me to start on the course which helped relieve the pain and eliminate the infection . I have no complaints and would not hesitate to use this site again .
6724	6724	What more can I say. Sorted my meds easily and delivered them quickly.

On the purchase list you only sell 300 mcg cream.I am waiting for your discount token because I think to buy some more vitaros cream not sold in france yet. best regardsfabrice ducaruge

6731	6731	"I got referred to this clinic from a sexual health service that I used and the website prescribed free treatment for me. (I think they have a reimbursement scheme with the other service.)

I would definitely recommend."
6732	6732	"I knew that it would take ages to get an appointment with my dentist to treat my gum infection so after searching on the internet I came across The Online Clinic.

6736	6736	"I assumed that the Online Clinic was just like shopping at Amazon - very much arm's length.  However, I needed some advice that touched on my prescription and was hugely impressed by the speed with which my query was handled.  i spoke to a receptionist who got a doctor to ring me back within twenty minutes. That is excellent service and particularly reassuring in a medical context."
6737	6737	"What I wanted wasnt in stock, I emailed to ask if it would be, they came back saying should be in a couple of weeks. I mailed in a couple of weeks to check, they mailed back saying it was in, and I ordered it and got it in the post within 2 days. Didnt have to organise a time consuming real time GP visit, all done online, proper job!"
6738	6738	"I had seen my doctor about my toe nails a couple of years ago, but was told it wasn't an nhs priority and that I should go privately. I just didn't have the time to find a practice, register and go for an appointment. My nails got progressively worse and I found the online clinic via Google after having tried all sorts of home remedies.It was so simple, I could provide all the information from home and a few days later I was taking the medicine and it's working. So easy, I would definitely recommend."

6751	6751	"Until using Victoza ,I had tried losing weight for a few years now with no lasting result due to various health problems. I have used for two months now and have lost over two stone. I did not feel hungry and had no craving for sugar. I did not change what I was eating except to reduce the amount and did not feel deprived at all. I previously had cravings for sweet things daily. I would highly recommend to anyone who has struggled with weight loss due to medical reasons"
6752	6752	"As a consequence of diabetes,surgery and ageing -I found that any erectile dysfunction NHS treatments were inadeqate.The Online Clinic clearly listed a far wider range of options.I found their service to be helpful on the phone and delivery as specified.If it were possible to list and order different strengths of medication that would be very useful too."
6753	6753	"I found the service from The Online Clinic excellent, very professional, easy to use, quick and efficient. I would definitely use the clinic again without any hesitation and recommend to friends and family. I completed the questionnaire describing my health problem and it was responded to very swiftly. The doctor prescribed a choice of antibiotics / penicillin and I chose, ordered and paid very quickly and easily. I was kept fully informed by e-mail the whole time and my medication was despatched by Royal Mail Special delivery the same day, with a tracking reference number. My medication arrived safely the next day and the treatment prescribed cured my health problem.A big thank you to The Online Clinic."

6759	6759	I needed to buy Malarone for a trip to Zambia. The screening process was straightforward and clear. The decision to grant prescription was fast and the price of the medication reasonable and promptly delivered.
6760	6760	The web site leads you to explain your problem and then asks questions specific to your medical history in order to ascertain the safety of any medicines that might be proposed. An hour or so later you receive a text or email informing you of the on line doctor's assessment of your personal condition.  One then returns to the website to discover what medication is suitable for your condition.  One chooses the course of medication and pays using a card on line. The medicine is then dispatched.  In my case I received what was prescribed the next day.My only criticism would be that amongst the medications suggested were some that I had said in the questionnaire were totally ineffective.I did however choose a medicine that was effective from the list and am therefore pleased with the result.
6761	6761	Within 48hrs of using site I had medication sent to me. Quicker than waiting for appointment with GP.Will be using again.
6762	6762	Exactly what I needed and arrived very quickly

6767	6767	Excellent service very quick with response would recommend. I will definitely use the online clinic again
6768	6768	"Let me start by saying that I am a convert to this - I am very satisfied ! But my experience can be broken down in to 3 events :- 1. I was suffering from a bad chest infection for which I was taking Amoxicillin 250 mg orally left over from a prescription I had from the dentist, but was running out after 2 days. I tried to get an appointment with my GP but was unable to do so for a week. I don't approve of going to A&E unless a genuine emergency so didn't know what to do next.2. I Googled ' buy amoxicillin ' which led me to Online Clinic website but when I completed the consultation found I was seeking treatment for Cystitis. I think this is a glitch in Online Clinic's system as when this request was rejected I was then directed to ' chest infections ' on the drop down ( what they call the patient's dash board )  but didn't see this bit of the web site when I first found it through Google. When I sent an e-mail enquiry to Online Clinic asking what to do ( having already telephoned to say that I wasn't suffering from cystitis, but wished to purchase a penicillin based antibiotic ) I got the reply that they couldn't help as they don't sell Amoxicillin, which is clearly rubbish. So all in all a rather confusing, and bad, start.3. The next day I had an e-mail asking me to complete the original online consultation which led to me being directed to the correct part of the web site. After that, the service was excellent. My request was dealt with in about 10 minutes by a Greek chap, judging by his name, and the medication arrived the next day. Extremely efficient and most impressive.4. Let me say that once I had negotiated the early stages, the service was superb and I would definitely  use Online Clinic again. I would use the service in conjunction with, not instead of, my GP and will have no hesitation in telling him what I've done. Quite frankly I think this is the future given that my local GP here in Devon seems to be overwhelmed with the elderly retired who just seem to fill the surgery nowadays. This isn't their fault, they've paid their taxes and are entitled to NHS care, but it does make it rather difficult for the rest of us who have to get better and go back to work. Many thanks to all concerned."
6769	6769	"Great service, very reliable. Fast and discreet delivery, I would definitely recommend, and will use again if I need too. Thanks."
6770	6770	I had treatment through this website and I needed a follow-up test and they recommended a partner clinic that specialises in lab tests online. The whole process was very smooth and saved me considerable time.
6771	6771	Excellent service ordered easily and received product in good time. Good communication with customer prior to despatch. Thank you.
6772	6772	"I have used The Online Clinic twice and on both occasions have been very satisfied with the service.  My queries were always answered promptly and professionally, and both orders were delivered on time with no problems at all."
6773	6773	A good website and consultation process. Even when I made a mistake in my order they responded quickly and accurately to what I required. It was a refreshing way to carry out customer service. Thankyou!
6774	6774	Thorough but simple medical assessment prior to issue. Very efficient. Quicker and easier than visiting an NHS surgery!
6775	6775	"I could not get in to see my own GP till the next week and I need antibiotics and the weekend was approaching, I had a consultation and approved for antibiotics and had them the next working day, very good service."

6808	6808	I found the service very quick and professional. I accidentally paid for a treatment not knowing it was originally included in the price. Staff were very helpful in refunding my money. I would recommend this clinic.
6809	6809	"I have been delighted with my experience of the Online Clinic so far.  I ordered my medication on a Friday evening and was expecting to receive it on the Monday.  However, it arrived the next day.  I was very impressed with the packaging and the trouble taken to ensure my medication remained chilled and protected.I have also been impressed with the level of care and the online instructions to administer my medication, which included an ""idiot proof"" video."
6810	6810	Service exactly as expected.
6811	6811	"The service was excellent, I received my medication within the timescale I was promised."

6815	6815	"User - friendly web site, most efficient service, rapid delivery. An exemplarytransaction."
6816	6816	I came to the online clinic because I had a badly infected lesion on my back after a an exceptionally bad bout of shingles. My own GP had given oral antibiotics which were useless. I am a very busy individual and did not have time to wait for another GP appointment and they refused to give me what I wanted over the phone even though I have a decorate in Science and knew exactly what I needed. The on line clinic came to my rescue.   The doctor at the online clinic agreed with my conclusion that this wound would respond to antibacterial cream and after viewing my photos he quickly issued the prescription.     The service was totally stress free unlike a visit to a GP surgery. I dream of the day when nearly all medical consultations will be tele-medicine like in nature.
6817	6817	"I had a very sore swollen face from an abscess under a wisdom tooth and the earliest ""emergency"" appointment with a dentist was 3 days. The online clinic prescribed me antibiotics and delivered them next day. Wonderful service and helped stop my infection spreading. Thank you."
6818	6818	I bought Liraglutide from this website and it arrived the day after I placed the order. The item was very well packed and included easy to understand instructions. They also provided a video to show me how to use the medication. I had a question and phoned up and got through to a lovely doctor who answered the question and asked me to call back at any time if I had any more questions. The medication has been very successful and I am about to request repeat prescription. I have recommended The Online Clinic so friends and family.
6819	6819	"I found the whole service to be excellent from the consultation to the aftercare, would definitely recommend"
6820	6820	I had some questions before taking this medication but they were answered quickly and confidently. There was a hiccup with delivery but was rectified and responded to speedily. Recommended.
6821	6821	My consultation was dealt with in around 5 minutes. I then logged in and placed my order on Friday afternoon and it was with me on the Saturday morning. I cannot think of a single thing to complain about. The whole experience was made very easy. I will use this website again.
6822	6822	"Good, fast service - well priced too."
6823	6823	"Had bronchitis rather than waiting in Doctors surgery (last time was for 90mins, think thats what made me ill) taking time off (im self employed) it was far easier, quicker and probably cheaper for me to order offline, filled in all my details and symptoms, my prescription was approved and medication sent to me within 3days........excellent service."
6824	6824	efficient effective service
6825	6825	I had a great experience and would highly recommend this service. I will definitely be using it again. I found them to be very professional and thorough and the service was completed in a most timely manner.
6826	6826	Clear website with lots of information and choice. Decision and purchase made very easy with competitive prices and extremely prompt service. I would certainly recommend without doubt.
6827	6827	"The consultation was dealt with very quickly (Friday evening) and the package arrived next day as promised. As the package contained vials, I was impressed at how well the items were protected and kept cool. It is a pity other companies are unable to provide such a good service. I was using another online pharmacy for purchasing medical supplies previously, but they were unable to supply what I needed. I will certainly be using The Online Clinic in the future."
6828	6828	Good and quick
6829	6829	"Super fast, efficient and reliable. A*"
6830	6830	"My online consultation was thorough but not too difficult to complete, and no electronic glitches encountered.  My order was very rapidly dealt with and dispatched very quickly.

I will recommend this website and service to all my friends and work colleagues."
6831	6831	I am able to get perscription medicine without waiting days/weeks for a GP appointment. I believe most intelligent adults comprehend what treatment is needed and this together with the safety net of an online Doctor safety netting the request for medication provides a fast effective treatment solution. The speed of service from the Online Clinic is excellent.
6832	6832	Firts time for me with this company and to be honest I cant think of a single thing to complain about. The service is impeccable. I acutually felt like I was getting personal service from a doctor. Maybe I was!

6843	6843	"I ordered from the online clinic, as it can be difficult to get a next day appointment at my local surgery. I felt unwell, and recognized the symptoms of an illness  I'd  had previous times before. I did not want to wait too long and be very uncomfortable, and anxious as to whether id get seen by my doctor.

6860	6860	I wish I had known previously that this service was available as I would certainly have used it for urgent healthcare needs in the past. Shame deliveries are not made over the weekend as this is when I needed the medicine the most and waiting several days was quite excruciating. I am pleased to have found this service as it has become increasingly difficult to get both dental and UTI assistance when it is urgently needed.

6973	6973	I am pretty impressed with the speed of the delivery from this website. When you cannot get to the GP and it is nothing major then this is a really excellent alternative.

When I am able to make an appointment, it is usually for a few days time and I can then be off around the country again.  I can order online wherever I am.  The service is excellent and the medication is delivered promptly.  I would not hesitate to recommend this site to anyone.  It is private and discreet."
6981	6981	"I had a tooth abscess whilst waiting to have a filling replaced.  I have had this before and so I know I need antibiotics as quickly as possible.  With no time for faffing around trying to get an emergency appointment at the dentist, I was able to e-mail the on-line doctor, get a diagnosis and prescription  within 4 hours of my first e-mail.  24 hours later my antibiotics were delivered to my workplace and I didn't have to waste anyone's time or take time off work.  Brilliant, this is the way forward!"
6982	6982	This website saved me a lot of time and hassle recently. I needed a sexual health check and they could not have made my life easier. I would definitely use this clinic again. The service is fast and the staff are friendly
6983	6983	I needed Duac Gel and no pharmacy near me had it in stock. I went to The Online Clinic and they had it in stock. I paid online and had the medication the next day. This is a service worth paying for.
6984	6984	I have bought a number of things online over the years but this is the first time I have written a review. The Online Clinic provides a really excellent level of customer service. My consultation was processed within a few minutes and I was approved to make a purchase of the medication that I needed. The goods were there the next morning. The instructions were easy to follow and my repeat prescription the following month was so easy to organise through the website. I cannot sing the praises of this company highly enough!

6990	6990	very quick service without any problems . Recommended
6991	6991	I found the whole process easy and reassuring given the doctor verification of symptoms and treatment. The postage took 1 day longer than I expected but otherwise very good.
6992	6992	"The Online Clinic is a great service, a great place to get help quickly and positively. The website is easy to use, and the responses from the Clinic are swift and helpful. Would recommend without reservation."
6993	6993	"The Online Clinic is an easy system to use, is obviously all online so can be completed in your own time rather than book an appointment with a Dr. The service was prompt, communication was helpful and polite. I would recommend using this service and will be using it again."

7000	7000	"I live in Germany and ordered Cialis on 16 Oct. 2014. The meds arrived the next day from the UK via UPS. You need to register and fill out a medical questionnaire which takes about 5 mins. The meds were the original from Eli Lilly. The checkout process was simple and easy to use. This website like many others now uses an extra layer of security for mastercard and visa. After confirming my purchase I was redirected to my bank website which asked me for my MasterCard SecureCode which I didn't have. I then registered my SecureCode password, logged back in to The Online Clinic and completed the order. Was considering 4 stars because I don't recall any SecureCode warning before starting the checkout process but maybe I just missed it.Super fast service.  Will order again."
7001	7001	Best service yet.  I was a bit weary ordering online but the  service this company provides is best you could get. I ordered at 2pm one day and had it at my door by 12 noon the next. Discreetly packaged and well wrapped and boxed for total protection from any type of damage to my item. The 1st time Iv had a service that does exactly what they say to the word
7002	7002	Not one for using the internet for anything it was my wife that suggested that I try the Online Clinic. Even I found the website user friendly! I got a prompt assessment of my problems and advice on treatment alternatives which helped me to feel in control of my own treatment. Ordering was simple and next day delivery of my drugs as promised. I have since used the online clinic when necessary and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
7003	7003	The website is very easy to navigate and the response times are quick. I got a reply from a doctor within minutes and was able to get my medication delivered the following morning. I will be using this service again.
7004	7004	"I've used the Online clinic few times already and I will certainly use them again, the service is perfect."
7005	7005	"This is a website I recommend. Excellent service, convenient shopping, ease of access and quick delivery. And most importantly, you can trust the quality of the products offered."
7006	7006	"I was very happy to be able to get my treatment from the online clinic, what a wonderful service."
7007	7007	I was very unwell with a swollen face as I had a tooth infection could not see my dentist for a week and doctors just as bad so I contacted the online clinic they were very fast friendly I didn't have to wait long for the doctor to read my problem and prescribe treatment I could not believe how great they were and my prescription was delivered the next day without any problems would use them again if I needed to
7008	7008	Quick! Descret and very professional service
7009	7009	THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND PROFFESIONAL. I COULD NOT BE MORE PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT
7010	7010	I've used other similar online services but l think the online clinic is more professional.They use special delivery rather than just recorded delivery .Would definitely recommend them.
7011	7011	Delighted that my issue was diagnosed and an agreed prescription was prescribed.
7012	7012	"Quick, easy and reliable service. I work long hours and can't access my GP unless I give a lead time of 2 weeks. This is the perfect solution to pre existing or non urgent medical prescriptions delivered straight to your door."
7013	7013	"Excellent Service, my order was received the next day and dealt with very quickly."
7014	7014	speedy communications and delivery- would use again!
7015	7015	This was the best site that I've ever used for medical products; the consultation is fast and the order/delivery is even faster. They're very prompt and the quality of the product is top notch!
7016	7016	"Fantastic service, delivered when promised the next day.  Easy to use website will definitely be using again"
7017	7017	I would highly recommend the on line clinic.. Answered questions very promptly and service was fast and efficient

7019	7019	"Fantastic company, they are fast, easy and safe to order from. I would recommend them to anyone. With real doctors evaluating your prescription."
7020	7020	The on line Questionnaire for my requirements was easy to follow and was not time consuming. In my weekend Dental issue the problem and treatment was dealt with promptly. As I have mobility issues at the moment The Online Clinic was a solution to my problem. Once used never forgotten. I would highly recommend this service and rate it as excellent. I will definitely  use  this service again. Thank you.
7021	7021	"Fast and easy online diagnosis, prompt prescription and good easy delivery."
7022	7022	"The online Clinic are the most professional web-based clinic you are likely to encounter. The consultation, diagnosis and prescription all happen online. All you need is an access to computer. You can expect to receive your prescribed medication in no time. Convenient, completely hassle-free and thoroughly recommended for busy people, who have no time for in-person appointments."
7023	7023	"Woke up on a Sunday morning with an absess on my tooth, searched the Internet for on line pharmacies and after going through 4-5 and reviewing them came across this one, I reviewed before I used it and all reviews seemed good so I thought I would go for it. I am nothing but impressed with this company and would recommend to anyone, I will definitely use again"
7024	7024	Good overall service
7025	7025	fast and efficient ordering process and excellent order and dispatch turnaround timetable.
7026	7026	"I undertook the consultation, made the delivery and had the medication a couple of days later.  Great service and the cheapest I could find.Thank you"
7027	7027	"Fast & friendly Service, will definitely use them again!"
7028	7028	"Perfect, fast delivery."
7029	7029	I did not even know that services like the online clinic existed until I did a Google search in frustration. So happy that I found this website where I was able to get a quick consultation with a GP and the medication that I needed was delivered the next day.
7030	7030	GP appointments are like gold dust these days and I could not get one and needed some cream to treat an eczema flare up. The Online Clinic doctor was very responsible and asked for a photo of the eczema rash. Uploading the photo from my phone could not have been easier. The doctor noticed that the eczema was infected so gave me a treatment that I had not had before and it completely cleared up the issue. The NHS could learn from this flawless service.
7031	7031	I needed some Malarone for my trip to Kenya and shopped around for a good deal. The Online Clinic seemed competitive on price but the thing that really grabbed my attention was how quick they were to respond to my enquiry. I sent them an e-mail and had a response within 5 minutes. I decided to go with them as they were first to respond and the price was in line with other suppliers.
7032	7032	I contacted The Online Clinic as I could not see my GP for three weeks. The online doctor reviewed my consultation straight away and approved me for my usual medication. I paid online and the package was with me the next morning. This is an awesome service - I will definitely use them again!
7033	7033	I didn't have the time to see a gp.this service was great and I was kept  up to date on the delivery of my medication.delivered next day as promised.would use again.
7034	7034	Prices are fair. Service and speed of delivery are excellent .
7035	7035	Got a very swift reply confirming acceptance of my order and arrived within 2 days. Thank you very much.
7036	7036	"Starting from the website, the information I found was professional and comprehensive. The real experience at the clinic was virtually perfect, with outstanding customer service. We even had a laugh while the procedure was being carried out."
7037	7037	Excellent.... Simple as that!
7038	7038	I cannot fault The Online Clinic. I had a tooth abscess that was driving me crazy - my dentist offered me an appointment in 10 days time - a time I would be at work and couldn't make. I had a consultation with the Online Clinic at a time convenient to me one afternoon and my antibiotics were with me the next day - I had finished my treatment before the dentist's appointment day even came around. Worth every penny. Thanks.
7039	7039	"Really happy, prescription was approved in good time and sent out on time as well."
7040	7040	Found this service very helpfull with no complicated questions and an answer within the hour great service
7041	7041	"Great response , however unfortunatly my prescription didn't work for me ( co-anoxic lab ), so had to go to my own GP today and got Amoxicillin 500mg... Fingers crossed but probably use you again."
7042	7042	"Brilliant service, next day delivery and never had a problem with quality."
7043	7043	"Ordering is very easy & all products have detailed explanations. Ordering & delivery are very smooth, easy & fast. Excellent."
7044	7044	"very good service, it took me about 5 mins to fill in the forms and then they replied with a treatment pretty much straight away.it was also very fast delivery great service."
7045	7045	The service has been excellent I will definitely use this company again. The treatment I have received is so far ok but I would like to complete the course before say how well it has worked for me.
7046	7046	I have ordered several prescriptions using this service and am always amazed how quickly my request is responded to and how fast my delivery arrives.
7047	7047	"Easy and quick to use, the prescription is expensive but if you take into account it means you don't need to go through the trouble of making an appointment with the GP getting though to reception the GP running late and getting the time off work to go to the appointment its very convenient and the cost of the prescription seems the preferred option over all that wasted time!"
7048	7048	"Had a dental infection and had already been prescribed a short course of amoxicillin by my dentist. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. I booked a further appointment with my dentist but felt that I could not wait 6 days. I was hesitant at first but after reading great reviews online I made my enquiry here at The Online Clinic and was notified via email within 20 minutes that my order had been approved. Next morning, 10am, it was here. In my opinion you really do pay for what you get - ignore people complaining about price. If you are desperate the price is more than reasonable. You are not forced to purchase from The Online Clinic so I think comments complaining about price are a little silly. Would recommend The Online Clinic to anyone and everyone should they urgently need medication!"
7049	7049	"Very impressed with this service.  Will definitely use again, highly recommend."
7050	7050	I filled in a form for the doctor and my med1cation was in the next post. Very reassuring. I'll definitely use them if ever I need them again.
7051	7051	"Professional first class service, would recommend without hesitation to anyone who has a problem."
7052	7052	"A great, straightforward experience which I will use again."
7053	7053	This is the quickest trustworthy service that i came across since a long time. They collect your medical history and analize it so that you can be safe when ordering any medication. Also they have the need to review it when you reorder it. The delivery is absolutely discreet and the next day you have your medication at home.Definately recomend it to everyone!
7054	7054	The customer support is second to none. The speed of delivery is outstanding.
7055	7055	The site is easy to navigate and provides a service to those who for one reason or another cannot or do not want to trouble their NHS GP for a simple or recurrent problem.I found the recommendations for treatment helpful as well as the other possible options if I had found them useful in the past
7056	7056	I found this online pharmacy that gives very prompt service
7057	7057	My wife needed some anti-histamine medication as I had left mine whilst away from home. Needed a prescription too without my doctor nearby so that didn't help. Explained my issue and the treatment had been given and got a prescription and the medicine the following day!
7058	7058	This is the most cost and time effective method that I have ever come across. You are kept updated on every move and I was rapted with how quickly my prescription was filled and posted. Never again am I going to sit in a waiting room for hours on end picking up sick people germs to see a doctor I don't like. Who needs all the hassles of repeating yourself for the same problem over and over again. Loved the experience and will definitely do it again.
7059	7059	"The site was easy to use and I got the product very quickly and received regular updates on the status of my order, from approval to dispatch."
7060	7060	"Fast and efficient, very happy with the service."
7061	7061	"I was a bit worried about getting medication prescribed online but I needn't have been. The doctor asked pretty thorough medical questions on the consultation form but this did not feel as intrusive as it might have been had it been conducted in person. Everything happened really quickly and my medication arrived the day after the order was placed. For people who lead busy lives, this is a good website and the cost is reasonable."
7062	7062	A good quick service. Easy process.
7063	7063	I ordered some antibiotics and they arrived promptly after a quick diagnosis
7064	7064	"An  efficient, trustworthy and fairly priced service, highly recommended."
7065	7065	Great service but that's what I would expect for the price. Poor information on website about delivery times if order placed on bank holiday.
7066	7066	A hassle free as rapid service that I would recommend to all. Thank you!
7067	7067	excellent service!
7068	7068	The whole process was very easy and gave me the confidence that it was as good as consulting a doctor face to face.
7069	7069	Prompt reliable service
7070	7070	I ordered from the online clinic i found their service to be extremely helpfull.After completing a consultation about weight loss they sent me a list of medications which could be of help to me. I ordered the chosen medication and recieved it in the post the next day.I would highly recommend this service.
7071	7071	Good assessment and fast delivery once reviewed .
7072	7072	good service fast dispatch but you can get them free and for cheaper
7073	7073	"It was a concern buying medication over the internet given all the horror stories, but my fears were unfounded. The tablets I ordered came very quickly and sorted me out. They were pricey, but worth it to get such a quick service in an emergency."
7074	7074	quick and easy service
7075	7075	Trouble free ordering experience and medication arrived the next day. Highly recommended and professional service
7076	7076	Never having ordered online before I was unsure what to expect. A straightforward questionnaire completed  and then the order was approved. I ordered and paid. Next day delivery as promised! Quicker than going to see my GP! Would recommend the service.
7077	7077	The doctor replied promptly and my order arrived the very next day
7078	7078	I ordered my treatment on a Friday afternoon and it was there at 9.30 am on Saturday. I have never written a review of a company before but this was so quick and easy I felt that I had to write one. I was going away on holiday on the Saturday afternoon and needed my contraceptive medication. I could not get to my GP to collect the prescription because of work commitments and The Online Clinic stepped in to save the day. I will be using them again in the future as it is worth the small private fee to save a lot of hassle.
7079	7079	I have been using The Online Clinic for the past 2 years for my contraceptive pill prescription. The medication always arrives on time and the communications are very good. I would recommend this website to anybody.
7080	7080	"My consultation/assessment was looked at and approved by a doctor within a few minutes. They sent me a text alert to let me know that this had happened and that I could log back in and place an order. I was very impressed at the speed that this all happened. The ordering process was very simple and my package arrived the next morning. Altogether, this was a very pleasant and hassle-free experience."
7081	7081	I submitted and paid for my order on a Saturday and my order was not viewed and approved by a doctor until the following Monday. Therefore I did not receive any medication until Tuesday afternoon. 4 days later than it was needed and to that end my condition was much worse than it should of been. I may as well have gone to my GP on the Monday myself and I would have had the medication quicker than I did using this service also at a third of the cost. Very disappointing. I do expect to pay more using this private service rather than NHS but I also expect better service to go with it and a weekend service was one of my expectations. After all what is the point of a private online service if it is only functional Mon-Fri the same as NHS. In this instance I could of got a quicker and cheaper service from my local NHS just by waiting a couple of days until thw Monday which I find very disappointing from an ONLINE clinic.
7082	7082	"As I live in France and find it hard to describe my symptoms and exactly what I need, the Online Clinic was a Godsend. After a simple online questionnaire, my prescription was authorised by a doctor and the NEXT DAY it arrived in the post! Fantastic service, highly recommended."
7083	7083	"Hi many thanks for your very rapid response, the problem resolved very quickly and I did not have to suffer over the weekend waiting to see my GP!Christopher Hawes"
7084	7084	My experience was a good one. Everything was easy to process and the goods arrived on time. It was much quicker than going to see my GP.
7085	7085	Every part of the service was very good. The staf were polite and very helpful when I spoke to them. I will certainly use them again and would not hesitate to recommend them to others
7086	7086	Great service. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone. And deffinately use in the future v
7087	7087	Great and fast delivery xx
7088	7088	I found the Online clinic very helpful when there was a long wait for Doctors appointments. On both occasions I was in pain and needed treatment in a hurry. They came to the rescue. Just 24 hours after I consulted them the right medicines were delivered to my door.
7089	7089	I needed some Malarone urgently as I was going off on holiday and had not realised that I the area where I was travelling to has a malaria risk. I could not get an appointment with my own doctor so I turned to The Online Clinic. I spoke to them on the phone to make sure they were legitimate and I had my medication delivered at work the next morning. The whole process was simple but thorough. It was not cheap but you get the service that you pay for.
7090	7090	The Online Clinic helped me out when my GP did not have time to see me. I will use this service again and have recommended it to others.
7091	7091	The symptom questionnaire was quick to fill out meaning I didn't need to take a day off work to visit a doctor. The online doctor confirmed my condition quickly and prescribed the appropriate treatment. Because my medication was delayed I received a discount off my next purchase which was great. Really pleased that the medication is sent in discrete packaging to save embarrassment. A brilliant service that I will use again thank you!
7092	7092	"I genuinely cannot rate the Online Clinic highly enough. The entire process from my online consultation to delivery of my medication was smooth and swift. My treatment was in my hand at 09.10 the next morning!This meant that I had  recieved the appropriate treatment for at least 48hrs before I could even get a GP appointment. I shall definitely be using the Online clinic from now on, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and family. If like me you were initially  dubious as to how such a service would work, please don't hesitate , go or it and you to will be highly thankful that you did. It has been so refreshing to recieve such a high level of  personalised,  completely confidential service, ensuring that I have rapid and effective treatment. My only regret is not having used the clinic sooner."
7093	7093	"I would fully recommend the online clinic, their service was quick and easy with good communication informing me exactly when product was to be delivered. My only negative would be that I had a question to ask and I had to wait until Monday morning to ask as phone line closed at weekend, but overall this was not a problem."
7094	7094	Ordered goods online which were dispensed the same day & arrived with me the next day. Fabulous service.  Many thanks. Jacqui
7095	7095	I am very satisfied with the quick service quickly and aid me
7096	7096	"Fast efficient service no messing and easy to use, I will defiantly be using again beats going and airing for ages in the local doctors / hospital / dentist"
7097	7097	"I used The Online Clinic because I live in Europe but wanted the confidence of a UK-based website. Registration was fast and easy and the diagnostic questionnaire was straightforward and uncomplicated. Once approval had been given, which was swift, the ordering process was simple and offered good prices. Delivery was effected from the UK to the South of France well within 24 hours using UPS. Can I recommend TOC? - for sure!"
7098	7098	"Signed up because of tooth ache, doctor confirmed prescription within an hour, was slightly put off because of price. However bad night sleep I decided to order and was received the next morning to work address. Quicker than getting in with local doctor without taking time out of work."
7099	7099	"I wanted to get a prescription I used to get in my home country (I'm an expat living in the UK) but that is unfortunately not available through the NHS. The Online Clinic offered the medication and the whole process, from assessment to receiving the medication was very quick, 2 or 3 days in total."
7100	7100	I have used the online clinic before and they have always been excellent. The price for the meds is as low as any other reputable supplier and usually arrives the next day with a tracked royal mail delivery. The website is clear and easy to use with detailed descriptions of the various products available.
7101	7101	Fast service a pleasure
7102	7102	"Very simple site to use, quick response to your online medical and treatment delivered very quickly. good communication and some discount offers for repeat custom. Only haven't given it 5 stars as no difference from competitors initially on pricing, however the repeat customer discount helps with that. will certainly use again."
7103	7103	I was very impressed with them; went online shared my intimate details; they were assessed and now my life has changed. Brilliant
7104	7104	I found the process very quick and reliable.Whenever a problem occurred an email was sent and replied with quick response.
7105	7105	I have no complaints. There service level was perfect and the website was easy to use. If only all online services were as efficient!
7106	7106	"My experience with the online clinic has been very good.They are reliable,trustworthy and keen to help.I will recommend this website to family and friends."
7107	7107	"I have to say that I was massively impressed with The Online Clinic. The doctor that I spoke to was very knowledgable about the rather obscure area of medicine that I was enquiring about. All the questions seemed thorough and my enquiry was handled very efficiently. They do not hand out medicine like sweeties, which is highly reassuring!"
7108	7108	"I have used a few online clinics and pharmacies over the years and this one is without doubt the most professional. My consultation was reviewed within minutes and I could then proceed to a purchase, which arrived the next morning. I have recommended this website to friends who have had a similar good experience."
7109	7109	Nothing to say except from everything was perfect. Product received very rapidly. Reliable company.
7110	7110	"Ordered Betnovite, after having been assessed by the online Doctor which was a straightforward procedure with my prescription arriving after 2 days.I would recommend this service to anyone"
7111	7111	Great service and good reply to query
7112	7112	"This service ticks all my boxes, ordered afternoon before and delivered next day... Faster than getting one from surgery"
7113	7113	This is the second time I have used The Online Clinic.Antibiotics were received the following day after quick completion of an online questionnaire which takes 5 minutes.This is then reviewed and signed-off within an hour or so by a qualified Doctor and a prescription issued to their Pharmacy for same day despatch .This is a real godsend if you can't get to see your Doctor Dentist etc for whatever reason.Highly recommend.
7114	7114	Ordering from The Online Clinic was very easy and quick. The delivery was very efficient. Experienced no problems whatsoever.
7115	7115	"I would have given it 5 stars but there were very few refrigeration packs included (not like last time) and they had melted and the product was warm. Still, it is an excellent organisation to deal with"
7116	7116	"Very easy service to use, prompt and professional service. Does what it says on the tin! Products are 100% authentic.Take into account the cost of prescription and secure delivery mechanism and the actual cost of the product is very competitive.Highly recommended.Thanks."
7117	7117	I WOULD RECOMEND THIS CPMPANY AS FIRST CHOICE
7118	7118	I placed my order with the minimum of fuss and my order was delivered next day as promised.  I'll definitely use TOC again.
7119	7119	i was suffering from a tooth abscess and had to wait 3 days to see a dentist i was accessed by filling out a form and prescribed some antibiotics i am now feeling 100%better thank you
7120	7120	I work shifts and find it extremely difficult to get  a gp appointment to fit in with my work schedule! Registered with the Online Clinic completed consultation 2 days later medication delivered.  Friendly polite staff at the end of the phone.
7121	7121	"Whilst ordering was fast and easy, delivery through UPS was a headache.  UPS ??now' advise they only deliver to a nearest Post Office and not the address as specified. Suspect drug company does not know of this problem. Package took two days to get to Australia, great.   It took 5 days to find the parcel, pity about the need to keep refrigerated as it sat in a post office for a total of seven days.  Suspect prescription is now somewhat less efective if any good at all."
7122	7122	Found this very helpful and effeciant
7123	7123	"Super quick, hassle free service!"
7124	7124	"I used this service and was very pleased with the service . Easy forms to fill in, plenty of info abput the treament. II simple lanuage. I would definitely use this service again"
7125	7125	I was in pain for 2 days before I decided to do something about it. With the long waiting time for my ordinary G.P. and many days waiting longer in pain I decided to look for an online doctor. I always remembered Harley Street being top rate far as medical physicians go and quality of medical service from what I have read in the media over my lifetime. I came across your online service and decided to register and apply for the required antibiotics as I have had this complaint before with urinary tract infection.  In the end its worth going private as you get delt with very fast and my antibiotics was at my home the following morning on a Saturday by Royal Mial Special delivery.  In my own personal view it was worth it as then by Monday the pain had stoped and I was able to go to work without having to take a week off work which would have been the case had I waited on N.H.S. G.P. appointment. Yes it serves an important service and vital for me at the time. I will use them again as and when I have too as always with my local G.P. I am waiting many days and up to a week for an appointment. In life I believe you pay for what you get!
7126	7126	"I ordered my prescription and The Online Clinic couriered it the same day. They kept me informed throughout the day and even called me to confirm I had received my order. Fantastic service, I wish all companies were as efficient. I won't be ordering from anywhere else."
7127	7127	Brilliant reliable trusted website I will be back thank you
7128	7128	"Communication is great with customer services, transactions are secure and everything ordered so far has came next day. A very pleasant experience overall!"
7129	7129	I received a comfortable understanding online consultation. Thorough questioning regarding all aspects of my health. A speedy delivery of the medication I was recommended for my particular problem. I would highly recommend this service. Complete privacy is maintained.
7130	7130	"I have no hesitation in recommending The Online Clinic as a trusted provider of online clinical services. As a team of Harley Street practitioners, the clinic's reputation precedes it and this team provides honest and responsible recommendations with a quick and easy online consultation and a fast and reliable prescription and delivery process."
7131	7131	"Easy to use website which enabled me to select my previous order and re-order for delivery next day all within a few minutes. Even more impressive was that the website actually notified me that the licensing aspect of the product had changed since my last order which meant that I could order a new, cheaper, safe generic alternative if I wanted (or the original manufacture version if I preferred). Excellent."
7132	7132	"Great service .super fast delivery , please from start to finish."
7133	7133	very pleased faultless service.
7134	7134	Really quick and efficient service with update emails and advice continually

7136	7136	"I have had two consultations with The Online Clinic now, and on both occasions I have been impressed with the prompt reply and assessment, and then subsequent prescription of the required products.  Delivery has also been incredibly prompt.  I would have no hesitation in recommending the clinic to anyone."
7137	7137	The online clinic provide an excellent & private service. Very fast & efficient & highly recommended
7138	7138	the doctor gave me good advice regarding my issue and purchase
7139	7139	"Great service, quick prescription dispensing & the treatment is working!!"
7140	7140	"the online clinic, has been the most competitive in terms of price, i have phoned them on one occasion and i found the adviser to be helpful , polite and knowledgeable. it was good to know that there is a back up service and my question was answered without me feeling daft!. The product I have purchased comes with full instructions and there was a video clip to watch so i knew exactly what to do. I would definitely have no reservations in using them above all others."
7141	7141	"I can't  tell you how much this service has helped me. It is difficult to get to an nhs dentist and service is not always great there. I have gained such relief from dental pain of absess by purchasing antibiotics prescribed by The Online Clinic. This is a totally reliable company, they work ethically with great consideration for the patient. The drugs I received were of an excellent standard, all details being clearly visible. They are the 'real deal'. The price point was very reasoble. The service was excellent and fast, arriving next morning. I cannot recommend The Online Clinic highly enough.  Superb. Thanks a lot."
7142	7142	Don't hesitate. Very professional and confidential service with excellent delivery times.
7143	7143	The service provided is discreet and efficient. Ordered at 11:00am Friday arrived first thing Saturday.
7144	7144	I highly recommend this side to my friend because it's good service in important mater.
7145	7145	Second or third order with the online clinic. Always speedy delivery. Genuine products discreetly packaged. Will use again.
7146	7146	"What a super service, reliable professional advice, reasonable prices, (even better with the discount offer) and speedy despatch. I would use this company again."
7147	7147	"I was dealt with professionally and quickly,and received the correct product at a good price and in good time."
7148	7148	I was pleasantly surprised to receive my order so quicly
7149	7149	The Online Clinic is a great service if you need your medication urgently and cannot get to a GP. I have used them for a number of issues over the years and have always found them to be highly professional and reliable.
7150	7150	Really great service from this clinic. I ordered on Friday afternoon and had my medication on Saturday morning. I needed antibiotics urgently for a dental infection and no dentist could see me in my local area and I could not get an appointment with my GP. The Online Clinic made my life a lot easier and the infection cleared up within a few days. I have no hesitation in recommending this clinic.
7151	7151	"I used this website to get some medication that my GP refused to prescribe as it was too expensive for the NHS. The treatment arrived the next day and it worked well and I have since been back for a repeat prescription. My weight loss on the medication is going well so I know that scare stories about medication on the internet do not apply to this website. I found the service highly professional and efficient. I also know that they do not just hand out the medication randomly as I recommended them to a friend and they refused to prescribe for her as medical intervention was not warranted in her case apparently. While she was disappointed, this gave me further confidence in their professionalism."
7152	7152	"I like the online clinic and trust their products completely. I have used them at least twice and the service is very reliable. Ordering is easy but limited and occasionally frustrating although I do understand why. The clinic do regular promotions which is good and better still, if you miss the cut off date, they are happy to honour the promotion via phone. Plus they are happy to answer any questions ore enquiries that you may have. Pricewise, I would like to seem them become more competitive. That aside, I will continue to use them on an as need basis."
7153	7153	If you don't like admin and complication just go for it!
7154	7154	"This is a quick - no, very quick - and efficient service by professionals. You order and it arrives the next day. What could be better ? Especially if you suddenly run out of supplies ..."
7155	7155	Very good service. Fast and reliable.
7156	7156	"Website is clear and very easy to navigate. The delivery is always next day and you are notified of receipt of order and dispatch by email promptly. I have had only one problem in more than 3 years which they corrected immediately without fuss or question. An excellent, trusted, efficient service. Highly recommended,"
7157	7157	I'd say these guys provide an excellent service for money value. Although not all tests are covered in a urine sample they have discretion to treat even an NSU without confirming testing positive (not a part of their polymer testing). Very good and definitely worth the money not to have to go to a clinic.
7158	7158	"I have used the Online Clinic several times now, with a rapid on-line diagnosis and recommendations for various remedies. The web site provides information on potential side effects and details when not to take the tablets - better than trying to get to see the GP these days!Once ordered the remedy arrives very fast with full tracking information available on the e-mails detailing delivery. Why would I go anywhere else.Thanks Online Clinic - excellent service.Ross"
7159	7159	Got a dental abcess and unable to get to a dentist or doctor. Ordered some antibiotics and received the next day. At 39.99 slightly over priced considering how much a prescription is but service is very fast .
7160	7160	Great user experience and reliability.
7161	7161	Even though there were delays in receiving my prescription this time round i was kept informed - it was especially nice to have a personalised email rather than a generic batch sent email which was responded to very quickly when i replied. I have never experienced any delays previously and find this to be a very convenient service that i will contiune to use.
7162	7162	No reservations on recommending to a friend in need. Thank you
7163	7163	This has helped me enormously with my weight loss. I am following a healthy low fat and low calerie diet too.
7164	7164	"Very happy with the service from you.  Easy and efficient, a little expensive but worth it for the service."
7165	7165	Excellent and extremely prompt

7179	7179	"I've been buying from Online Clinic for some years.  The consultation process is simple and efficient.  The ordering is easy apart from one thing: you can't order more than one item per invoice.  No matter: just raise two orders.  But sometimes I call them on their geo-landline [not the 0870] and their people are always helpful.  They seem to remember your name from one call to the next; even if it's a year since.Delivery is always quick, normally next day.Nice and easy, not always the cheapest, but highly reliable."
7180	7180	"Ordered late afternoon, my order was delivered the next lunchtime. I have no reservations in recommending this clinic to anyone."
7181	7181	"I would definitely recommend this company to anyone. Very fast delivery, the website is very easy to navigate."

7193	7193	This company provide a great service and deal with you in a professional way while providing a discrete and excellent attitude to your needs.
7194	7194	The review and notification was very swift and the correct treatment was sent very quickly. A good service.
7195	7195	"I would recommend the Online Clinic without hesitation. Their response times are very fast, and any queries I sent were replied to straightaway. Medications were delivered next day, which is very quick indeed. The whole process is faster and more straightforward than waiting to be seen by a GP. A point to note is that I already knew what conditions I required treatment for."

7206	7206	Amazing service. Discrete professional and extremely helpful
7207	7207	"This is a good source on genuine branded medication from a UK clinic. Its a shame they cannot prescribe for a wider range of symptoms, but if you need antibiotics quickly I would recommend."
7208	7208	"I find it a pain trying to get a doctors appointment that suits my work and social life. I know what I need and my local doctor is unwilling to give me a running repeat prescription. Using this site I was able to purchase exactly what I need at a small premium to a normal prescription, and it was delivered quickly. Would recommend. I am a repeat customer and will continue to use in the future as and when I need."
7209	7209	Easy to navigate website. It was clear with al yet he necessary information. It gave me a lot of confidence in the company. The next day delivery was excellent. The whole experience trouble free.

7211	7211	I order yesterday and they turned up today . You do have to sign for them which can be a problem but it worked for me
7212	7212	I appreciated the fact that the order was fast and the service was so reliable. I also like the fact that they ask so many questions about our health and if we have any other problems.
7213	7213	"The analysis result took a couple of days to arrive. The treatment instead was delivered immediately afterwards, on a next day delivery. The staff was absolutely available also on the phone for any doubts and really supportive in going through the procedure."

7224	7224	"I needed my regular contraceptive pill as I could not get in to see my GP. The Online Clinic had my medication to me the morning after I contacted them. I do not see how you could beat this service. Also, I only had to pay ?29 for a 3 month supply and this included the consultation, prescription and next day delivery. Good value for this fast and efficient service."
7225	7225	I would recommend this company to anyone 100% service and a pleasure to do business with
7226	7226	service very good  but i can buy the same tablets from pharmacy 2u for half the moneylike 28 tabs for ?98 which i shall try next time.
7227	7227	"I really appreciate just how easy it is to order online. Once you've completed a form about your current health state, it only takes a few clicks and I can trust that my prescription will arrive promptly the following day. Re-ordering is even easier, and I thoroughly recommend the Online Clinic for all your prescription needs."

I was then informed that it was out of stock and offered an alternative or a full refund.The service was and is better than the high street
7233	7233	"I would recommend TOC [The Online Clinic] to any one with a medical problem which is covered by their services. As a doctor myself I understand from both sides of the consulting table what is needed to provided a good and safe clinical service, but one which is centred on what the patient needs and wants.Good e-consultation process and one which covers all that is needed. Comprehensive range of treatments for erectile dysfunction, all drugs and doses covered at very reasonable cost.Good that the new generic version of Viagra is included at much better cost profile now."
7234	7234	Very good service.
7235	7235	Order completed and delivered on time.
7236	7236	this is the easiest and fastest service available if you need online prescription for medication !!! I am from Ireland and i found it very easy to use !!!

THANK  YOU VERY MUCH !!!
7237	7237	The initial checks appear thorough (and obviously based on trust) but then an online Company has to ask the questions to protect both parties. The route to the sildenafil was just slightly confusing initially but we got there in the endOverall excellent serviceWe'll done

7239	7239	I have to say that I was massively impressed with this service. I do not write a lot of online reviews but this one really deserves the 5 stars that I have awarded them. My NHS GP was utterly useless and I approached The Online Clinic out of frustration. The doctor that I dealt with was amazing and he gave me advice that turned out to be spot on. I am now cured and can get on with my life. The service was very discreet and everything happened very quickly.
7240	7240	"I cannot rate this company highly enough. I have ordered from them 3 times and each time the order was there the next morning. And what is more, the treatment was highly effective. Big recommendation from me!"

7275	7275	"I'm becoming a long term customer of the OLC. Staff are knowledgeable, helpful and delivery is always next day. They have a price-match policy which means I can always be sure of the best price and super-fast delivery. Excellent service!"
7276	7276	"Couldn't fault the ease of using The Online Clinic - I totally recommend it.  The service was easy to use, confidentiality kicks in, and on-going treatment easy.  More importantly, the speed of delivery was exceptional.  Although I have only used the site for one type of medication, it offers multiple options, multiple costs to suit your purse, and the initial consultation was surprisingly not embarrassing in the least."
7277	7277	easy and reliable. I would recommend.
7278	7278	Have used the online clinic for various prescription and have always found the site easy to use and their response to orders super quick. Information is always provided quickly on the progress of orders and any diagnosis
7279	7279	"Excellent and reliable delivery, easy to navigate website. After the recent website makeover however, delivery information section is difficult to find. I would recommend making this easier to find as it was a major factor when I first decided to purchase with your company."
7280	7280	I have used the Online Clinic for several years with total satisfaction.From the initial consultation I was impressed by the professionalism.They have always been efficient and delivered always arriving as promised. With the introduction of generic products it makes the service even more attractive.I anticipate using the service for a long time to come.
7281	7281	Fast and great service
7282	7282	"Have used the clinic over a few years now without issue. The service is always prompt, efficient with good updates on how your order is being processed. Would recommend"
7283	7283	"I have been very satisfied with the proffesional  treatment of a delicate  topic, and appreciacte the advice of various treatments not based purely on profit."
7284	7284	Cannot fault The Online Clinic. Ordered at 3 pm and had my medication at 8 am the next morning. Very impressive!
7285	7285	I have been using The Online Clinic for a regular prescription for the last 5 years. The order always arrives on time and I feel that I get value for money. I am happy to give them a recommendation.
7286	7286	I have used this website on a few occasions and always found them to be highly professional. My order always arrives the next day as they promise.
7287	7287	"I have found the service provided to be excellent, with great communication and prompt delivery of any medications I have needed."
7288	7288	My consultation was dealt with around 10 minutes after it was submitted. The whole process was very easy and I was able to get the private prescription that I needed over the holiday period when my GP surgery was closed. This service is truly exceptional and I have no hesitation in recommending The Online Clinic.
7289	7289	I actually got referred to this website by my GP as he said that it would be easier to get my regular prescription online and he was right. I probably would not have even thought of getting a prescription online were it not for my doctor recommending it.The service provided was truly excellent. The consultation was thorough and my order arrived the next morning. Getting a repeat prescription was very easy. I am glad that my GP put me onto this service as it has made my life a lot easier.
7290	7290	"I contacted this online clinic after getting terrible service elsewhere. The Online Clinic is not the cheapest provider of private prescriptions (not the most expensive either) but it is the best, based on my experience of 4 other UK companies. The Online Clinic seems to be in the mid price range but the service level is unbeatable. My consultation was processed in around 15 minutes. I had a question and one of the doctors got back to me in 5 minutes. I went ahead with a purchase at around 3pm and it was delivered to me at 8 am the following morning. I really cannot rate this company highly enough. I will be back for more."
7291	7291	"Items are sent Next Day Special Delivery, but Royal Mail delivered to the wrong address.  Not only did The Online Clinic send out another immediately, when the original did finally arrive, they allowed me to keep it to compensate for the inconvenience caused to me by Royal Mail.  They kept in touch constantly by email until everything was sorted and their staff were very pleasant to deal with.I would highly recommend this company and will definitely deal with them again in the future."
7292	7292	I have used this company several times over the past 5 years and have always found them to be extremely reliable. The products are genuine and the service is fast. I have no hesitation in giving them a top rating.
7293	7293	"Such an easy to use website and what lovely staff! I wanted Reductil to lose weight but it was no longer licensed apparently and they explained the reasons and offered an alternative. They put no pressure on me to purchase the alternative and I got back in touch with them a week later and they knew exactly who I was and all my details were stored in the patient record that I created online so I did not have to go through the whole process again. I ordered the recommended treatment and it arrived the next day. I lost 8lbs in the first month and I have just ordered a second month supply. They were very careful to make sure that I was losing weight and that I had not had any side effects. The doctors here are very professional, which was something that I worried about using an online service. I have no hesitation is recommending The Online Clinic."
7294	7294	I have been using The Online Clinic for 4 years and they have always given me a good service. They are regulated by the Care Quality Commission so you know that you are dealing with a real clinic and not a bunch of cowboys. The order is always there the next day and they have a friendly customer service team if you want to order over the telephone rather than online.
7295	7295	I have ordered two batches of Tamiflu from the Online Clinic. Both batches were delivered promptly and I found the price competitive versus batches available in UK pharmacies.
7296	7296	I had hydra facial done by the lovely Dyna and omg my skin has been glowing even after 2 weeks. She was so gentle and professional. She talked through everything she was doing... It showed she truly knew the ins and outs of her job. She was exceptionally clean with how she handled my skin. Extremely pleased and can't wait for my next treatment with her
7297	7297	Absolutely superb treatment!I had my hydrafacial with Dyna and my face was radiating after. They use Skinceutical products which are amazing and the clinic also looks really nice - it is a pleasure to see them.The team are very professional and lovely. Dyna talked me through the steps of what she was doing and made sure I was comfortable at all times.Will definitely remain a loyal customer!
7298	7298	Yet another welcoming visit at the Cavendish in Fitzrovia! I was given a very warm welcome by Tess as soon as I arrived. I always love coming to the Cavendish clinics as I feel so relaxed and all the staff are very professional. Dr Denning was wonderful as always! Thank you!
7299	7299	"I had a hydrafacial with Dyna and it was amazing! I was having a few skin issues prior to my treatment (right before an event!) so decided to book an appointment at the clinic and honestly it was the best thing I ever done. My appt started off with an in-depth skin consultation where Dyna assessed my skin and gave me a breakdown of what the treatment would be. The hydrafacial itself was great, Dyna explained every step and made sure I was feeling okay at all times. I honestly couldn??t recommend her enough, she gave me loads of advice on how to take care of my skin and just overall made the experience really pleasant. She also recommended a skincare regimen and products that were tailored to my skin type. I could tell from the get-go that Dyna was not only an expert at what she does, but she genuinely cared as well. Will definitely go again!"
7300	7300	"Dyna was incredible, so gentle and informative, great at tailoring my facial to my skin's specific needs! The clinic is fabulous, great experts- they really know what they're doing."
7301	7301	Rebecca is amazing
7302	7302	"Within 2 sessions I am a different person. A 100% confident woman with a knowledge and glorious cavendish clinic practioner who has given me hope. I suffer from hormonal acne and am so grateful for Rebecca who was instantly personable and knowledgeable About every single product she used (and I am very nosy). She explained exactly what each product does to the skin and how it will impact me in the long haul. She explained potential vitamins which would support my skin journey and provides a regime which has been my go to since we first met a few months ago.  I could not support and be more positive about this clinic, for not judging the lifestyle that the majority of us have and providing a reasonable skin care regime irrespective of the life I lead - so so so rare. This was about impacting my skin while leading the same life. Thank you Rebecca - I will be shouting cavendish clinics name from the rooftops."
7303	7303	My first time with Dyna and not my last! She was so welcoming and was comfortable in her company from the very first minute. She kept me in the loop throughout the entire hydra facial so I knew what was being done.Definitely worth the time & money and can??t wait for my next one!
7304	7304	"I had cool sculpting with the lovely Dyna, so warm, welcoming and friendly. Dyna explained everything in detail and made me feel so relaxed before, during and after the treatment and has even followed up with me to see how I am and if I had any questions. I would highly recommend the cavendish clinic and Dyna in particular. Looking forward to my follow up appointment and the results from the procedure. Would definitely book future treatments, check them out, everyone is so nice and welcoming, worth a visit, especially if Dyna does your treatment."
7305	7305	I had a derma needing treatment with Dyna and she was just fantastic. She explained the procedure thoroughly and was super gentle. I looked the best I had in years for weeks after. Definitely a repeat and forever loyal customer to the Clinic.
7306	7306	"I am a regular of Dr. Dennin??s, some might say too regular as I??m a perfectionist particular when it comes to my face. I??ve surveyed the premium market for service providers and Dr. Dennin is perfection. When tend to do our own research prior, self-diagnosis (which is usually wrong), and you can have every faith that Dr. Dennin will give you a completely honest assessment of what is needed to achieve the results you??re looking for, even if it means (usually in the case of a top up) no treatment. She genuinely cares for her patients, is a complete joy to engage with, she doesn??t up-sell or push products unnecessarily   simply to make a profit for herself or the clinic (who are staffed with very warm and friendly support). She herself is a perfectionist and in my several treatments I??ve not had to come back once for corrections - again I tend to see defects where they may only be apparent to me, and many doctors out there will exploit that and treat you whereas Dr. Dennin will give you the most "
7307	7307	"I've visited this clinic twice now and the staff couldn't have been lovelier. Dr Catherine Denning is the best. She listens patiently and suggest what's truly best for you, not for their wallet. The other staff are very nice and helpful as well. I can't recommend them enough."
7308	7308	"Very Nice Experience - I was talked through each stage of the process which was good as I had never had a facial before.  I also have very sensitive skin so was a bit apprehensive, but had no adverse reaction, so the products really are allergy free and skin-friendly."
7309	7309	Great service and lovely team ????
7310	7310	The session was comfortable but I never got a call the next day to confirm how I was doing. That normally just adds the cherry on the cake. Otherwise so far I am happy.After their reply we got a call and they were amazing took time and answered all the questions. I change my review to 5 stars.
7311	7311	"Honestly the Cavendish Clinic has the friendliest staff. The ambience of the place is on point and the service is great. They offer an array of services with  qualified consultants to match. I would highly recommend the hydro facial there, for anyone who has never tried it. It's amazing, your skin feels hydrated and refreshed.Keep it up guys....."
7312	7312	Very professional
7313	7313	I am really happy to be treated by Aga at Cavendish Clinic in Fulham. She is very knowledgeable and competent with long experience fromthe trade. She can be highly recommended. Christina
7314	7314	This was my 5th time visiting Cavendish Clinic and this time for the new EMSCULPT treatment.I always feel like I??m heading back for a catch up with friends rather than going in for a treatment which is always lovely considering how nervous I know some people can be about treatments.I wouldn??t go anywhere else.
7315	7315	Loved my facial here! Would hire my recommend. My skin looked so refreshed.
7316	7316	lovely people great results! what more can I say?
7317	7317	I've been visiting Cavendish Medi-Spa for several years now and always leave feeling very happy with my treatment and the experience I've received. I feel I've had really good advice and my skin looks much better as a result.
7318	7318	"Gorgeous clinic! The team were warm and welcoming, I'll definitely be back."
7319	7319	Very friendly and professional staff. I'm delighted with the results and will return. I would also recommend to anyone looking for the treatments they offer
7320	7320	Thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience!! My skin has never felt or looked better and left me with a nice glow. 100% couldn't recommend enough!
7321	7321	"Cavendish is the only place I trust with my skin. They only provide the safest, most effective and advanced treatments and I will never go anywhere else! I just had my first microneedling treatment with them and honestly I??ve lost count of the comments I??ve had on how amazing my skin looks. Can??t wait for my Tixel in November!"
7322	7322	I have been going for Hydrafacials for over a year and I love it. Really friendly and professional environment
7323	7323	"I am not overly impressed with my experience so far. I was told to come over for a consultation, the lady who did my consultation was not a Dr even though the procedure I am interested in is performed by a Doctor. I requested a second consultation with a Doctor, they booked me in on another day, when I got there the consultation was again with a therapist. Lovely ladies but not the Dermatologist they assured me I??d see. I requested days off "
7324	7324	Lovely treatment but miss Lizzie
7325	7325	They made a huge mistake with my booking and no one really apologised. They were also hard selling their treatments.
7326	7326	Consultant was professional and friendly but pricing was ridiculous in my opinion
7327	7327	"The staff for so friendly and knowledgeable on all things skin related. They really educated me on the hydra facial and did an amazing job. The facial left my skin instantly radiant, flawless and incredible. Will definitely be going back!"
7328	7328	"I am doing a course of Velashape treatments and after 3 sessions already starting to see results, very pleased!Pleasant environment and very professional therapists, I would recommend!!"
7329	7329	First class experience!  I was a bit anxious but was made very comfortable and nothing was too much trouble for Weronika at the Parsons Green Clinic.  The initial assessment was very thorough and there was no sales pressure.   I was talked through the different options open to me.  All the staff were very friendly and professional.
7330	7330	"Well-equipped clinic with wide rage of services and products, friendly and professional staff, great customer service."
7331	7331	"A lovely clinic. However, the therapist perhaps was not as experienced in using the hydrafacial equipment as others. The therapist used all the devices but her technique was very different and I did not get the results I usually get from a hydrafacial."
7332	7332	Excellent advice
7333	7333	"I've had two hydrfacials at the Cavendish Clinic now, the first one earlier this year ahead of my wedding and my skin absolutely glowed on the day! Their expertise, friendly and professional staff make this my favourite place for a special facial. I highly recommend them."
7334	7334	Lovely clinic with a very accommodating booking team. Honest and experienced Dr. Wouldn??t go anywhere else.
7335	7335	"Great service, kind staff!"
7336	7336	"Lovely staff, very understanding and relaxed :)"
7337	7337	I found not only the facial experience incredible - the light shield was a great way to end the treatment - I also found the skincare advice the Dr offered me extremely helpful.
7338	7338	"Horrible customer service, revolting care and unacceptable standards of behaviour from the actual people working there. I will never buy their products or services again! And by the way out there you can find lots of products which are better, more natural and even less expensive."
7339	7339	I have had the hydrafacial twice and absolutely loved the experience on both visits. I felt so at ease the staff were all very friendly and completely went into detail with every step of the treatment. I left with my skin glowing! Couldn't recommend enough :)
7340	7340	It was my first visit to Cavendish Clinic and I had gone on a recommendation. I couldn't have asked for better service and am thrilled with the results. Definitely deserves 5 stars.
7341	7341	This is the best Facial I have ever had!Cannot wait for my next treatment! I would highly recommend their hidrafacial as I came out of there glowing and my skin felt incredibly healthy! Best Clinic I have tried in London!
7342	7342	Excellent experience!
7343	7343	"I had the cool sculpting treatment with very good results. My first visit was purely informational, and importantly I did not feel pressured into any treatment. I was warned of side effects, matching what I had read online elsewhere. When I later chose to go ahead, everything went exactly as I had been told. Fortunately, I did not experience any side effects. At all visits I felt well informed by the friendly staff."
7344	7344	"Apart from the difficulty in obtaining an early appointment, all my experience at Cavendish clinic has been very good."
7345	7345	* great customer experience with staff * products are very high in quality * consultants are very attentive and professionally skilled
7346	7346	"I had the coolsculpting on my underarms and back. The staff were very attentive and friendly. I returned 3 months later and the results really surprised me, because it's a slow process you really don't notice but the result was brilliant! I will be going back"
7347	7347	Always consistent and excellent. Highly recommend
7348	7348	Very knowledgeable and friendly staff. I had the cool sculpting a few weeks ago so still waiting to see the results!
7349	7349	"I visit the Fitzrovia clinic and am always made feel so welcome from the moment I walk through the door. You are immediately made comfortable and offered a beverage while waiting for your appointment, however the wait is never longer than a few minutes which just shows how organized the clinic is. Elena was fantastic at my consultation and really listened to my concerns and recommended products she felt my skin would benefit from. What I especially liked was that she didn??t swamp me with ten different creams or treatments and overselling, which gave me even more confidence that I was being looked after. I then went for the amazing HydraFacial and if I could have one every day, I would! My skin felt squeaky lean after and my make up sat so perfectly the weeks after. It is such a treat visiting Cavendish, from the friendly smiles on arrival to the amazing treatments and products available and level of professionalism from all the staff, I really couldn??t recommend more!"
7350	7350	Dr Veerle was amazing and really took the time out to listen to my concerns and help in addressing them
7351	7351	"I honestly think Cavendish is the best clinic I have ever visited. In particular, Rebecca was so friend and professional, attending to all my need and providing with me with her honest and expertise view.  100% recommend."
7352	7352	Excellent experience
7353	7353	I had a course of 6 treatments at the Cavendish Clinic and was treated by three different therapists. Everyone I met at the clinic was friendly and efficient and I enjoyed my visits. My treatments were always on time and carried out professionally. I would definitely recommend the Cavendish Clinic.
7354	7354	"Im not a fan of needles and although the microneedles are painless it was nice to feel comforted and in good hands. Excellent facility, customers service and care throughout the microneedling procedure. My skin is literally glowing post procedure!"
7355	7355	Lovely staff and treatment.
7356	7356	It was a wonderful experience would love to win this I really have difficulty within my skin so it??ll be a bonus for me however love the way the keep clean at everything there hygiene manners I??m really happy and opportunity to win this muaaah??????????????
7357	7357	Very pleased with the consultation and treatment.  Thank you.  I will be back!
7358	7358	Excellent as always really care you are comfortable and getting the best outcome possible.
7359	7359	"Staff was very friendly and was able to give me the necessary information needed face to face and also with a booklet , which was helpful to go home and have a close look at treatments that I was interested in.."
7360	7360	I walked away feeling confident. There was honest discussion about likely results and downsides. The staff were friendly and helpful. The appointments are never rushed.
7361	7361	"Professional service, nice and clean clinic, great location"
7362	7362	"Really good, saw visible improvements on the day and had glowing skin!"
7363	7363	Great clinic with lovely professional team!
7364	7364	A good clean and professional Clinic.
7365	7365	"Most amazing coolsculpting session, completely changed my appearance of my stomach so so happy!"
7366	7366	Lovely staff and flawless service. Would definitely recommend.
7367	7367	On arrival I was greeted by happy and friendly staff. During my treatment I was made to feel very comfortable which I enjoyed. The staff was able to answer any questions I had and was very knowledgeable. A lovely clinic in a great location!!!
7368	7368	Very polite and attentive would go again definitely
7369	7369	Such a lovely experience at the Cavendish. Professional and friendly staff. My skin was gorgeous afterwards!
7370	7370	The staff at the clinic is friendly and professional. I had a facial and it was good.
7371	7371	"The experience with Cavendish was informative, and very easy. The staff were happy to answer all my questions, and attentive the entire time I was attending the clinic."
7372	7372	Best of the best. My go to facial by the one and only aga! Would recommend and have done many times.
7373	7373	Really enjoyed my hydra facial!Very friendly and knowledgable staff
7374	7374	"Very good therapist, great service. However, it did feel a little rushed between treatments. I only learnt afterwards that immediate massage of the areas treated for 5 minutes improves the outcome. The therapist did massage the areas, but fairly sure this was for no longer than 2 minutes. No results yet after 3 weeks, but was told not to expect for a couple of months.Thanks for your reply. However, I read this report: Massage. Recent data revealed that massaging the affected area right after the CoolSculpting treatment for at least five minutes improves fat reductions by 68% after the first two months and 44% after four months. The massage performed on the patients can be described as a vigorous kneading motion followed by a circular movement using the pads of the fingers."
7375	7375	Love this place. Highly professional. Sorted my skin in two weeks
7376	7376	I had a facial a week ago and my skin is looking infinitely better- so much so that 2 people commented on my skin just today. Very professional environment and I can??t wait to go back
7377	7377	Reliable and comfortable!
7378	7378	"I absolutely love the Hydra Facial at the Cavendish Clinic, it??s really helping the skin renewal on my cheeks and clearing my forehead. Highly recommend!"
7379	7379	"Very good treatment, friendly staff."
7380	7380	Had many treatments (including injectables) at the Cavendish Clinic Parsons Green. Most recently I have had a treatment course of Celluma to help with pain from arthritis. Happy to report it has helped greatly. Would highly recommend the Cavendish Clinic.
7381	7381	Very kind and professional
7382	7382	"Very professional, knowledgeable and so nice. From the moment we walked into the clinic. Above all, they were able to  accommodate my husband and I for a joint consultation. Rebecca took her time and explained the whole procedure and shared her own personal experience. Just need to pluck up courage the get coolsculpting done."
7383	7383	"Been to the clinic twice now after being recommended and can honestly say Aga is amazing and everything is so seamless. My skin was pretty bad when I went to see Aga and after 2 visits its like new skin, can't wait for my next facial."
7384	7384	"The whole experience was very smooth; from consultation to treatment the process was informative and reassuring. Elena also followed up with me to make sure everything was ok, I'm just excited to see the results now!"
7385	7385	"My therapist was knowledgeable, attentive and very helpful. I was made to feelVery at ease.  There was no pressure to buy into or book anything.  Even the consultation was unrushed. I wouldn??t use any other clinic to make changes to my body."
7386	7386	"I visited the clinic once, the receptionist was very professional,  the nurse was amazing and had a wealth of knowledge in what we were discussing. I look forward to to visiting again whenever possible."
7387	7387	Excellent and very quick service leading up to the appointment. Provided with a lot of helpfull information about the facial and general health of the skin. Looking forward to booking facial with Cavendish clinic soon!

7394	7394	"AMAZING HYDRAFACIAL!It's been 2 weeks now, and skin is still glowing from my HydraFacial.The whole experience was great and relaxing.I was talked through each step and explained what it was for.

7396	7396	Excellent service! Perfectly chosen treatment thanks to a cosmetologist professional!

I have tried many treatments and lasers and peels but this really left my skin looking plump, refreshed and just healthy really. Looking forward to my next one :)"
7406	7406	The hydrafacial performed on my skin wonders!!!! I felt so relaxed and not rushed! The aesthetician was amazing and gave me good advice to take on for my hyperpigmentation. I will definitely come back. It??s been 3 days post facial and my skin keeps looking better no word of a doubt!!! - I??ve been convinced this is the go to facial.
7407	7407	"Concise and clear advice with no over-sell or unneeded extras, which I appreciated."

I will definitely be back.

7414	7414	The deep dermabrasions facial with all the bells and whistles is absolutely fantastic. I get lots of compliments for several weeks after I??ve had one. Cavendish clinic certainly knows how to take a few years off your skin. I always look forward to my facials with them.
7415	7415	"I have had a number of treatments as Cavendish including CoolSculpt, Veloshape and Hydrafacials and would highly recommend the clinic.  Both Gosia and Fran are excellent at what they do and also very good company during the treatments.Can't ask for more."
7416	7416	The team are so friendly and caring.  Dr Catherine Denning is wonderful.  Very skilled and a lovely person.  I look forward to my visits.
7417	7417	"Wonderful therapists, very effective treatments and a great location!"
7418	7418	Everyone &everything is wonderful.Had the HydraFacial my skin feels so good really hydrated and healthy.Thank you again Rebecca I will be back in June.
7419	7419	"The team are always so friendly, welcoming and professional... I love coming to the Cavendish Clinic!"
7420	7420	"I called several skin clinics in London to discuss options for my skin, but  it wasn??t until I spoke to the lovely guy at reception at Cavendish Clinic that I knew I finally found the right place. After a pretty in depth discussion about options , i decided on the hydrafacial, and so happy I did! My first visit to the clinic was great. It is centrally located,clean,bright and inviting. The receptionists are all super sweet and welcoming . Before we even began, My facialist took the time to explain the hydrafacial to me as well as other procedures which may work for my skin . I went ahead with hydrafacial and throughout each step she explained what was happening which was really nice for my first time since although it is not at all painful, there are different sensations for each stage of the treatment- pulses for lymphatic drainage, cool feeling for the chemical pee"
7421	7421	Great treatments. Great staff
7422	7422	I have had my Velashape treatment . Very comfortable! Can??t wait to see the result after finishing the whole course.
7423	7423	"I have been going to Cavendish Clinic for years and trust Aga completely. They are extremely knowledgeable and skilled - and I trust the advice they give me. A loyal client, I have had great results with cool sculpting, LPG, Botox and fillers."
7424	7424	"To say the entire experience was amazing is an understatement. Cavendish really took personalised service to the next level.The environment is clean and relaxing. The team really are on top of their respective field and quickly put me at ease.The entire experience pre, during and post treatment was flawless."
7425	7425	I couldn??t recommend cavendish clinic enough. The therapists genuinely care about the results you want. I have the hydrofacial every month and it is incredible!!!! Highly recommend xxxx Anna
7426	7426	"I had Coolsculpting and Radio Frequency treatment at Cavendish Clinic. I'd say I've had a great experince with Elena there. The best thing about she was so not sales driven and her main focus on only what I needed and how to get the best results. Plus, her kind and friendly approach made feel so comfortable to carry on with them. Cavendish is a great clinic to receive an honest/proffesional opinion on what kind of treatment you need.Results-wise, I'm very happy with the outcomes of my treatments and you really get your money's worth for it. I'd recomend Cavendish to anyone without hesitation."
7427	7427	"The staff were very professional, friendly and helpful and I was made to feel very comfortable. All my questions were answered pre procedure and everything was explained throughout. I??m already thinking about what other procedures I can have there."
7428	7428	"friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.First I had a thorough discussion with a doctor, without any pressure to commit to any treatment.When I decided to go ahead (a few months later), it all went perfectly well. Now waiting to see some results!"
7429	7429	Rebecca services are always amazing very friendly she is always felt comfortable when I am there for treatment. Thanks Rebecca
7430	7430	I go to Cavendish Clinic for a monthly Hydrafacial treatment. They're always professional and my skin has never been better.
7431	7431	Great experience as always. Lovely treatment and very pleased with results. Would thoroughly recommend.
7432	7432	"Cavendish Clinic (Parsons Green) is such a comfortable experience.  They are so knowledgeable and sensible - as well as being kind and professional from top to toe.  They haven't pushed me too far into treatments I wasn't sure about but have encouraged me to try things that have really made a difference.   Very, very good."
7433	7433	Eleanour was super knowledgeable and wonderful - what a glowing hydra facial! I am already looking forward to going back.
7434	7434	"Excellent treatment, very friendly and helpful staff"
7435	7435	Ultherapy. Really delighted with my initial result following my treatment at Cavendish. The all round experience was great and the clinic is lovely.
7436	7436	Ultherapy Treatment.  I wasn't sure what to expect - was recommended this face tightening from a friend.  Really surprised - great experience. Looking forward to the results - face already feels tighter !Special mention to the Cavendish team. You were great !  Long forward to seeing you again. Thank you.
7437	7437	Excellent team! Lovely clinics. I always feel well cared for and looked after. Would highly recommend.
7438	7438	"After a recent Ultherapy treatment I am excited about the results that will follow.  I can't thank Lisa enough.  I always enjoy fantastic service from the team at Margaret Street.  Knowledgeable, friendly staff all focused on my needs.  Looking forward to the refreshed 'me' in 2019."
7439	7439	I would recommend this treatment. The confidence I have gained in having it has made such a difference to my life. Cool sculpt is painless and works so well.
7440	7440	"My free counselling session  was my deal breaker. It was a detailed, patient, and satisfying session. And above all honest. All the side effects were stated upfront and I was assured that the clinic would handle it professionally. My treatment experience was equally satisfying, Rebecca was like a friend who made me comfortable and ensured a smooth and professional execution. Rebecca also followed up post treatment  to ensure my comfort and to check if I had faced any problems post treatment. The clinic was hygienic and all the staff was warm and welcoming. I strongly recommend the clinic be considered and costs be overlooked. I await my results and hope that they are as good as my experience."
7441	7441	"Really professional and friendly team. I had some coolsculpting and I was a little nervous about the treatment, the team put me right at ease and were so helpful in explaining everything - I can??t wait to see my results. Thanks guys, keep up the great work."
7442	7442	Really great service and amazing people working here. Absolutely a wonderful clinic and I recommend them to everyone!
7443	7443	"Cavendish clinic kept sending me emails and offers for some time, the last offer i thought i should take it it was treatment for 335 pounds, when i call them to book they asked me for deposit which will be redeemed against the treatment, i went on time , i thought as they keep contacting mew i will keep using them instead of going to some one else, when i was there i asked the price of eye cream she said 70 pounds and this was the cheaper, i trusted a company like that should be honest with the prices and treatment of their clients, i paid for the treatment and the cream comes to 405.00 pounds as i thought they did not drew the 25 from my account as i did not see it in my bank account statement, this all happened after 7pm, left to home arrived before 8 pm, right away checked the price in other shops i found the same product was for 41.50 pounds by the way there was no price on the product when i purchase it i relied on the employer word, right away at 8pm i wrote them email saying i do not want this product and will return it, the following morning around 11am i was there with the cream with out open even the bag which the product was in , gave it to the receptions un touched, she refused to pay me back my money said it is there policy not to refund any money , there was no where i could known if they have this policy or no one told me when i purchase it, i insist of having my money they insist not to give me the money saying they will keep it in my account ( I do not know where is this account) for a future treatment , now i do not want to go back to them they took the product and my money , if i knew they do have a policy as they are saying i would never have bought from them, it seems they clink on your money to chain you to them and keep going to them, if they are really have this policy, i came back and tried to check if they cash the 405.00 from my account i found out they cashed the 25+405, i called them told them the 25 should not been taken from my account they said they will send it to my back to my account. next time i will tell you about the treatment i had. with this clinic be carful with your money, i felt they are there to suck our money from us in many ways,follow up ;They say they can not refund me my money because of there terms and conditions, where is these terms and conditions and why no one tell us before we buy or pay for any thing then we know there policy at that time it will be our mistake, but they keep it hidden and use it when they like. as far as no one tell me these conditions and i have no knowledge of it  because it was no where to see in the shop and no one of them tell us their terms,  then they have to refund me my 70 pounds back and next time if it does happened then it would be my fault and my responsibility.  this way of treatment clients make them loose money and people they would have made more money from me if they treated me better because i was going to use them for every treatment i do, but for 70 pounds they lost may be thousands. you make money not from keeping peoples money but from doing a good job and better treatment you will gain more work and clients.follow up,she answered as you see here telling me to send them email, i did but no answer, as usual. my money still with them."

7589	7589	Had the most amazing experience with my first facial with Lisa from The Cavendish Clinic.Various mechanical aids were used to supplement a cleansing experience which left my skin feeling more supple and younger. Highly recommend the Clinic and if you can .. ask for Lisa. She clearly knows what she is doing.
7590	7590	It was my first time at the Clinic and since I went in everyone was super friendly and nice making me feel super comfortable. Elena was my therapist and she was very knowledgable and walked me through every step of the treatment. At any moment did I feel like she was pushing a product or a treatment. I was really happy!

7596	7596	"I felt completely looked after from the moment I entered the Clinic. My aesthetician, Lizzie, was incredibly knowledgable and gave me so much time before my treatment for an in depth consultation about my skin concerns, by current routine and the kinds of treatments offered. Lizzie recommended a HydraFacial, which was wonderful and was the perfect balance between relaxing, with the lymphatic drainage massage, and active, with full extraction and glycolic acid treatments. I am already looking forward to my next treatment!"
7597	7597	"Attentive, knowledgable therapist who was very calm, understanding and didn??t try to sell products or treatments that I did not need. She clearly explained every step of my treatment and I was not made to feel rushed. My facial was top notch."
7598	7598	Went to Cavendish Richmond recently and had a bio-activ face peel. It was a lovely experience in a calming environment. My skin felt really rejuvenated afterwards and several people commented on how good my skin looked.

7611	7611	"First of all and I think the most important I need to review treatment-hair mesotherapy for early stage of male hair loss. It worked with me, new stronger and thicker hair started to grow after few weeks so that??s  most important. Also the way I was treated was amazing. Lisa has been so kind and sweet through whole 6 weeks treatment and all staff members has been really amazing and helpful. I would definitely recommend this clinic."
7612	7612	"Courteous, helpful and efficient."
7613	7613	Excellent!!
7614	7614	"My overall experience at Cavendish Clinic has been nothing short of wonderful. I was attended to, and treated by, Senior Aesthetic Practitioner Gaila Jancyte at the Welbeck clinic. First, I was practically a walk-in and she made all effort to see me despite a very busy schedule. Following an initial consultation on Coolsculpting, I felt so comfortable with the clinic and with Gaila that I wanted to get it done immediately. Again, she made a great effort to accommodate my request. Throughout the treatment, Gaila was professional and attentive. The big plus with Cavendish Clinic is they can work two Coolsculpting machines simultaneously, which cuts the treatment time by half. I am very happy with the result so far. Subsequently I went back for a facial with Gaila and came away with clean, glowing skin! The clinic has a great offering and Gaila is efficient, patient and very knowledgeable - I could not recommend a better clinic or a better practitioner."
7615	7615	"Professional , caring and efficientGaila is faultless I am very happy with my treatment"
7616	7616	Galia was absolutely amazing!!! The environment was very comfortable and I will highly 'recommend Cavendish Clinic.
7617	7617	"For a first hydrafacial I had a glowing result. Naturally, I did expect scars to be less visible and scars to have disappeared but I would need a course of treatments. The only thing I can critique is that I wish there was more focus on the effected areas, which are full of pigmentation instead of my nose. I will definetly try have another though and use the products too."
7618	7618	"I highly recommend Cavendish clinic (Parsons Green) to anyone interested in maintaining a youthful glow! Incredible professionalism and tailored skincare advice, a wide range offering of dermatologist develped skincare and the latest in skincare technology."
7619	7619	The whole process was so professional from answering my inquires till doing the treatment. The practioner gave me all the info needed before and during the treatment. She was really competent and caring.
7620	7620	The staff was excellent and very professional. They really put me at ease and paid attention to me. Their expertise ranges across a very wide selection of products and techniques.
7621	7621	Great service- great quality! Highly recommended
7622	7622	"My skin has really improved since I started having regular facials at Cavendish Clinic.  The staff really listen to my concerns and the facials are always so relaxing and the therapy rooms are clean and calming. I particularly like the Hydra Facial and while I always chose Gosia as my therapist, the others are all excellent too. They also sell Nimue, Obagi and Skinceuticals products."

7643	7643	"10/10. Fantastic service every time. Can't fault them. The practitioner who performs my treatment (exillis) is excellent, so caring and professional."
7644	7644	I had a microdermabration done. The consultation was very thorough. The procedure was relaxing and the clincian constantly checked comfort levels throughout the treatment. The results could be seen after a few days. It really does make a difference to skin tone and texture. There wasn't a mask or massage as part of the treatment as advertised on the website but the facial did thoroughly clean and refresh the skin. The clincian had lots of useful tips and advice. Overall a pleasant experience.
7645	7645	I have been a customer a very long time.People are generally very nice and the environment also but there is a huge turnover and as soon as u get to know a teraphist she is gone and the next one generally does not have a clue re your history.
7646	7646	Excellent care!
7647	7647	I've been to a lot of clinics for various treatment but this clinic is the best and I can't recommend it highly enough.

7656	7656	"I had cool sculpting done with Cavendish around two months ago (Feb) , On my waist. I was never really that flabby, more just flat. I Decided I wanted to go ahead with it just to give me a little bit more definition. Its now April and I can massively see the results. I got both sides of my waist done at different times. I've only just recently had my right hand side done so still awaiting to see my results. I know you're supposed to wait 3 months until you start seeing full blown results But I can honestly say I can see the difference on my left hand side already AND its only been two!Such lovely ladies too!Made me forget I was getting a procedure done at all.The procedure its self in my opinion isn't even as uncomfortable as I expected it to be!

Ms Gosia has looked after me so well, I would be silly not to use her again. She is very polite, explained the process in every single detail, she made sure I was comfortable, and most of all I could really feel she knew what she was doing - which I can assure you, doesn't happen very often in other beauty salons or clinics. I've come out feeling looked after and satisfied with the money spend.

7752	7752	My first visit to Cavendish and I wasn't disappointed. Emerged from my treatment totally relaxed and refreshed!
7753	7753	"I have been attending the Cavendish Clinic for five years and have always been completely satisfied with their service. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly and give good advice on suitable products and treatments. Beauty appointments are personalised if need be, to a client's own needs. The clinic is beautiful and clean and has a lovely atmosphere. It is situated in a very nice residential part of Parson's Green, which is frequented by local residents, including myself. I highly recommend the Cavendish Clinic and their wonderful staff !"
7754	7754	"Staff is knowledge is second to none. Most of the places they try to sell you different treatments and products wether or not they are suitable. In Cavendish clinic they care about the client and will advice in regards which products or treatments are required and nothing else. Cavendish clinic use only quality products. Rooms are well decorated, great calming atmosphere and the smell, 'oh the smell' is wonderful. Love this place."

7762	7762	I have been visiting the Parsons Green clinic for several years now. I have always been delighted with my treatment and Aga and Kasia have always provided excellent advise and treatments. I highly recommend having a facial with either.
7763	7763	"Lovely friendly staff and wonderful place to come for treatments with results already showing. I have been a number of times over the passed few months, nice quiet clinic where they really look after you - Elena has even run out to get dinner for me."
7764	7764	"Perfect! Professional Coolscuplting treatment, much better location than other clinics I've been to before. The therapist was so good I've signed up for Laser treatment Next Week."
7765	7765	"Lizzie did a top notch job, great results and was professional and kind."
7766	7766	Needed a facial peel and was assigned a Polish lady called Gosha who was absolutely lovely
7767	7767	"I had heard great things about Cavendish clinic so decided to give them a go and I wasn't disappointed! Such a friendly team, great service and enjoyed every second of my appointment - it's my new favourite place!"
7768	7768	"Really professional and friendly therapists, make you feel comfortable and relax. I had laser treatment which wasnt painful at all. I took also a coolsculpting session for my inner tights. 1st month after treatment the results were amazing!. Its been already 3 month after... My tights are 5 cm slimmer!!! Just cant believe how effective is the treatment. 100% recommend!!!"
7769	7769	"I went to Cavendish Clinic for CoolSculpting on my axillary puffs and was really happy with my treatment. On arrival I filled out a really simple consultation form and was met by the therapist who took me through the treatment. She knew everything there was to know about CoolSculpting and was extremely professional in a very friendly manner. During my treatment, she made sure I was comfortable and checked in regualry but left me to just enjoy the couple hours of calmness whilst the machine worked it's magic. They made it really relaxing and it gave me a chance to catch up on emails and watch a bit of television which was wonderful!! I'm re-booked in to see the results in a couple of months and looking forward to going back! The team make you feel like your a friend and that is really important. I would high recommend to friends and family."
7770	7770	I'm very happy that I've chosen Cavendish Clinic to have my Coolsculpting and facial treatments done. The staff members are very helpful and friendly.
7771	7771	Really great service and helpful team
7772	7772	Good team and great service
7773	7773	Excellent service and great location!
7774	7774	"Went to their clinic in richmond to chat with their staff and review my options. Professional, knowledgable staff, and seemed like they honestly wanted to help / provide me with what was best for me rather then just some sales pitch to sell me the most treatments possible."
7775	7775	"Visited Cavendish clinic last year. Very professional, friendly and great range of treatments. A hidden gem in the heart of london. Recommend highly."
7776	7776	"Best facial and Microdermabrasion ever. I have a very sensitive and alway had problems getting Microdermabrasion in most clinics in London. But since I found cavendish clinic in parson green, i so look forward to my nxt appointments wth Gosia whos so warm and friendly."
7777	7777	"Great experience, very professional service and staff. Felt very comfortable and was really pleased with the results after just 1 treatment. Will definitely be returning."

7784	7784	Elena Maxim was very professional.  I was put at ease throughout the initial consultation and the subsequent sessions.I was told what to expect ((initial uncomfortable feeling when the applicators are used etc.) during every session.Was made comfortable and given complimentary coffee & a meal during the sessions.She answered all the questions I asked.I should see the results of my coolsculpting  in 3 months.

7789	7789	"Extremely friendly staff, I felt that I was being very well looked after."
7790	7790	"A lovely experience , professional and knowledgable staff, excellent ongoing results ."
7791	7791	Amazing meso treatment and made to feel totally at ease. Lisa Littlehales was so patient and put me totally at ease. Would recommend her and this treatment to all my friends.  Highly satisfied. Can't wait for next time. Customer service was second to none. Perfect.
7792	7792	Felt very looked after. I was out at ease from the very start. Would highly recommend.

7796	7796	"From my first enquiry all the staff I met were really friendly and helpful and explained the different treatment options well. Customer service was excellent, the whole experience felt very professional and luxurious (the clinic is lovely and spotlessly clean). Would definitely go back and recommend them to others."
7797	7797	Staff and premises all brilliant. Thank you
7798	7798	Great customer service very professional staff nice clean well kept clinic
7799	7799	"Very happy with the treatment and results. Fantastic team, very professional."
7800	7800	"Having been for many treatments over the years, I have been delighted to find Cavendish Clinic in Parsons Green. I went for the Nimue skin treatment and was so pleased with the results, I left the clinic glowing. On top of that my therapist, Aga, was so knowledgeable and informative. I am very happy and would highly recommend the clinic to anyone looking for good factual skin advice with a friendly atmosphere."
7801	7801	I'm very happy with my treatments.I can highly recommend it.
7802	7802	The staff are so welcoming and friendly as I was quite nervous prior to my coolscupting treatment. My results were amazing my husband now wants treatment!
7803	7803	Excellent. Charming and professional staff could not be faulted.
7804	7804	I come here regularly and I'm very glad I found this place. I had a few minor concerns regarding my skin but always had reservations about doing anything about it. That was until I met Maxine. She is the most friendly and approachable clinician and will give you her honest advice regarding any concerns you may have. After a few sessions of Exilis my skin feels and looks noticeably different. Wish I found this place a long time ago.
7805	7805	Very friendly and professional staff. Effective treatments using latest technology
7806	7806	"Excellent service at the clinic on soho square, which I managed to book via email abroad even though I confused my appointment time I was able to re book on the same day at a later time. The nurse was amazing, super efficient and knowledgeable the process was quick and painless especially for someone like me who??s phobic of needles. The consultation was professional and the appointment was over and done with so quickly it was excellent. I was able to obtain a really detailed receipt for my insurance company and the whole payment process was really easy. Highly recommend service 5 stars."
7807	7807	"I went to Kings Cross LTC twice. First time I had a really good experience, very professional. The second time, absolutely terrible in every possible way, painful, too fast and I don't think my arm was wiped. What's worse, I asked specifically if multiple vaccinations can be done at the same time which I thought is a bad idea, and I've been told yes. I found out after reading the instruction  that they should NOT be given all in the same arm if given at the same time. These are supposed to be trained people, but this is unacceptable. Now I have to find out what next, are these vaccines going to work as they are supposed to or what?"
7808	7808	"Booked an appointment online. Got here. No one. Nobody knows why S they only rent a room in a bigger health centre. They have contacted me several times by txt to remind me of the appointment. There was no txt regarding any delay in the appointmentI go to voicemail There was a message. The nurse has had problems with transport and will be here 45 minutes late. I did not answer the phone as I donot reply to those without caller ID the voice mail took 20 minutes to arrive. So let??s see if they show up.....This is being edited/added to at their request. As they say no one was late in this day MondayWhen the Nurse did arrive after 40 minutes she was abrupt??you here for the Travel clinic???(I??m the only person there waiting) I was expecting something more like ??hi,I??m sorry I??m late??. I informed her I was off to Boots who I was talking to on the phone when she arrived. This was at Wandsworth and I have email correspondence with the Customer Care section regarding the whole affair, offering a free consultation and discount"
7809	7809	"Booked an appointment a week in advance and let them know which vaccination was needed. When we arrived, they didn't have the vaccination in stock so we wasted half a day. I gave them a chance to make it right by emailing them what happened afterwards. It's been more than a month now and they didn't even bother to reply.Will not consider this place for my vaccinations in the future"
7810	7810	"Don't get ripped off by this place, they charge you a ?15 'appointment fee' on top of every vaccination, even if you're having a vaccination for something like rabies where the vaccine comes in course of three injections and your subsequent visits require no further consultation. Many local pharmacies offer travel vaccinations at much cheaper prices, like Camden Travel Clinic, which is within a pharmacy and they only charge ?186 for the whole (3 injection) course.Where as London Travel Clinic charge ?90(!) per injection for their rabies course. So with 3 injections needed, that would cost a whopping ?270 with them! So save yourself ?84 and get it done at a pharmacy!"
7811	7811	"I have now visited the London Travel Clinic, Orpington branch three times for my travel vaccinations. Each time was a positive experience. The nurse ( a retired GP) was very knowledgeable and made sure that I was covered for all the main risks (in Borneo). Additionally, she sent me a link to up-to-date travel health information which should prove helpful for future overseas trips."
7812	7812	I used Orpington London Travel Clinic which is a little hidden away but the customer service was excellent so I would definitely recommend and encourage others to use - great for me who gets a little nervous with vaccinations
7813	7813	good experience would come back
7814	7814	"Really friendly and helpful travel nurse, thorough information about suggested travel vaccines was provided and the whole process was quick and efficient."
7815	7815	"Attended the travel clinic in Orpington on two occasions, on both they were able to accommodate me last minute and provided me with a wonderful service. Super easy to access and I felt confident in the advice I was being given. The nurse was extremely knowledgeable and actually listened to my concerns. 10/10 service! I will definitely be back before my next trip!"
7816	7816	"Do not go here, absolute rip-off. Charged me ?104 per person for malaria pills and I later found out could buy for ?39 from CityDoc Clinic (much better service). They also insinuated they were part of the NHS surgery next door because I was able to get vaccinations but my kids and wife weren't because they were registered elsewhere, but then admitted they had no affiliation. Also charged me ?15 for a consultation to discuss what vaccinations to get and told me to come back in a couple of days to have them, then charged another ?15 for that appointment as well. Won't be using them again, there are much better/cheaper options."
7817	7817	"Very easy to find, receptionist was lovely and the nurse (Richard) was super helpful both in administering the injections and being curious about my upcoming trip - providing advice where needed. As a whole it made the experience easy and informative."
7818	7818	Recommended ... very helpful!
7819	7819	"on arrival there was no one to ask for directions or help. The signs on the wall were unhelpful. I sat and waited for the next available person, who in the end couldn't help because she wasn't part of the clinic. I had to search around for help. I waited 30mins to be seen then tried to sign in again. I was then told by the clinician that I'd missed my appointment and couldn't be seen today. All she did was hand me customer services number, she didn't seem to care. My issue is the fact that there was no one to assist. In most practices if a patient is running late the clinic would call, to see whether they were ok. I didn't receive a call."
7820	7820	"I just want customers to be aware that this clinic charges you almost the double as Boots for a Yellow Fever Vaccination. Asking the clinic over the phone, a person claimed that the difference in price wasn't big. For clarity, I never visited the clinic, I was about to but cancelled when I realised how overpriced their service was."
7821	7821	"I feel like I was just conned. That was such a rip off, so upset. I paid ?15 for a lady to google the prices of anti malarial drugs and google what vaccinations I need. All of which I did myself before and chose to go to the clinic for a professional opinion. I have tried to find a way to make a complaint and the website shows no option to do this. I basically woke up, went to Victoria and gave away ?15."
7822	7822	"Went to Oxford Street clinic today for vaccination, nurse was not very willing to answer my questions and not very attentive. Nurse failed to do perform health and safety procedures i.e. washing hands and swabbing/cleaning my arm before injection, and refused to perform these basic procedures despite me reminding her to do so."
7823	7823	"Attended the Liverpool St branch today. Lucky that I have read some reviews on Google and here in order to find out that there is no logo of London Travel Clinic and that it is based in one of the office buildings at the address (the same where Regus is based - just look for it on Google Maps) on 1st floor (just ask the receptionist when you are signing in).I was early for my appointment with some other patients when we were told that it seems they might reschedule our appointments because their computer is not working and they won't be able to bill us. Also we were asked to fill in the questionnaire again, but that's a question of 5 minutes. Luckily the nurse suggested that if we will be able to pay in cash they will be able to provide the vaccines. I went to an ATM and came back within 10 mins, went straight to the office and was told that the computer is now working and I will be seen in a minute. The appointment was straightforward and quick, I have received important information about my trip to Tanzania and Zanzibar and was also told given a few tips from the experiences. Although I was coming only for a yellow fever vaccine, I was then offered according to the government website the typhoid vaccine as well which I decided to go for. I have also managed to buy the Expedition Plus Insect Repellent which I would need to buy somewhere else anyway.Summary - happy with how easy you can book the appointment and with the approach. I find the service really useful. I would only suggest to have some branding (at least a logo) outside of the building."
7824	7824	"Visit to the London Travel Clinic branch in King's Cross has proved a frustrating experience and time wasted.I appreciate the general directions on the website but finding the clinic with address on hand only is extremely difficult.- clinic's name is not displayed anywhere on the building or entry door (instead there is 'Regus' logo above the entry - which is an agency letting office space) - the building looks  like any other, difficult to guess its a clinic, especially when all the blinds are down in the evening - the main entry has no intercom, no entry button, no sign pointing to the entry button which is unmarked and on the side of the unlit wheelchair ramp, easy to miss in the evening (which normally you wouldn't think of using if not in a wheelchair),  just a touch device for staff - on arrival door locked - - I called up a number on the notification for help on how to get there, way before I reached the building and also when I was standing in front of it - no response When I finally got in, frustrated and tired, it was exactly 15 min past my appointment time (even though I arrived at the address on time having previously duly filled the consultation form online) so the only thing I achieved was rebooking and receptionist's 'have a good evening'.Far from that!"
7825	7825	"Booked online for a consultation and specified I was looking for Hepatitis A and B vaccinations. Got to the clinic first thing in the morning for my alloted appointment, waited for 5 minutes in an empty reception and then someone came out to greet me and tell me that the Hep A and B vaccinations weren't available due to a global shortage.The fact that they're unavailable is fine and I was treated politely in the Clinic, but I have no idea why no one could've let me know in advance so I didn't make a completely wasted journey (which involved taking time off work too). They had my phone number and email address and could've saved everyone time and effort by getting in touch.I was annoyed anyway but then several hours later received a presumably automated text from the clinic saying that I'd missed my appointment!Dreadful service all round."
7826	7826	"Extremely overpriced if you compare it to any other travel clinic. I went to the Victoria one where the nurse was very kind but left me in pain for 10 days which suggests she was not the most experienced plus ""forgot"" to charge me for the malaria pills so i ended up going back to pay an additional ?90 which cost my husband almost 50% less in boots. Its a rip off."
7827	7827	I went to the Victoria branch in my lunch hour and very impressed. The staff were friendly and knew exactly what I needed for my trip to Burma. I will be recommending as is so convenient and you can get all your travel needs here.Thank you.
7828	7828	"It was straightforward to book online and I found an appointment at short notice at the Liverpool Street clinic. When I arrived, I was seen promptly. The nurse, Linda, was very professional and courteous. She explained matters clearly and performed the injection well. Price matched that of competitors.This clinic seems to be run exactly as it should."
7829	7829	"I had my travel injections at the London Bridge clinic this weekend and it was a great experience. Easy to book a slot on their website, the cheapest I could find for the jabs I was having, and good availability with long hours and some last minute slots too. The nurse (Gina) was absolutely brilliant - she sensed I was nervous and we had a funny chat first to put me at ease. The least painful injection I've ever had - she just slid the needle in gently rather than the stabbing that so many nurses do! Would recommend 100% - thank you Gina!"
7830	7830	"Trying to phone was impossible (the Travel Clinic number rings for 10 minutes at a time then cuts off, I never managed to get through), so I quickly switched to the website and realised how easy it was to book an appointment, just 5 minutes from my workplace. Filled out a brief health check form and was seen the next day.I only waited a few minutes, I was called in on time and the nurse was extremely warm and friendly. She made me feel really comfortable as I hadn't had these vaccinations before, she explained all the diseases I was being vaccinated for and how they are spread. She asked if I was ok with needles and I explained that I sometimes get queasy and she was so reassuring. She chatted to me the whole time which I think eased any nerves I had. I'm not sure I've ever met such a friendly nurse!I was out within 10 minutes and I felt like I had all the information I needed for keeping healthy during my trip.I would highly recommend this service for last minute vaccinations. They were expensive, but given the situation I expected this."
7831	7831	"Went for a yellow fever vaccine ahead of work trip to Ivory Coast. Nurse was incredibly helpful and friendly, made sure not only that I got vaccine I requested but also that I was aware of all risks of going to the country."
7832	7832	"Very thorough, information given and options discussed clearly."
7833	7833	I turned up a little early and they were able to see me sooner than my appointment.The nurse was really friendly and gave very clear and sensible advice. Including recommending that I get vaccinations for free via the NHS.
7834	7834	"Nurse is really nice ! Easy to book, fast and effective :). You can have advise on what you'll need to do with your travels, what to be carefull about once in the country etc.. I strongly recommand !"
7835	7835	"As always, a great and personal service every time we visit with the family."
7836	7836	Had a great experience at the Liverpool Street London Travel Clinic to get my travelling immunisations. Dr was very friendly and happy to talk through everything and answer all my questions too. I was slightly nervous getting the injections but he was happy to wait for me to be ready and help calm my nerves. Great experience and very conveniently placed in the city.
7837	7837	"Was greeted by name at reception and then taken into a private room with a nurse. Very attentive and knowledgable, took her time to discuss the type of trip I was planning. I only needed the Hep A jab and was in no way pushed to have others which were optional. Did not even feel the needle! Very pleased and would definitely use again in the future."
7838	7838	Excellent service
7839	7839	Excellent service provided. All information was explained in clear concise manner & was genuinely only sold what was required and also take your medical history into account. Definitely recommend them.
7840	7840	The nurse was very nice with my little boy. He was very clear in his explanation. Recommanded!!
7841	7841	Booked our appointment the same day. Consultation was informative and not unduly long. Nurse was professional and very friendly. Wouldn't hesitate visiting again.
7842	7842	"I booked LTC before traveling to Costa Rica. It was a last minute arrangement and I'm pleased to get an appointment within 24 hours. The visiting nurse was very nice. She explained current epidemilogical situation in Costa Rica, then recommended me vaccination. I had tetanus. The whole appointment took less than 30 minutes including injection. Things I particularly like about LTC: ease of booking, easy to find them in central London, minimum waiting time, friendly staffs, no cross selling, updated travel info. Highly recommended."
7843	7843	Very conscientious nurse who was very thorough in going through previous inoculations before deciding what was needed
7844	7844	"Lovely guy saw my partner and I, early, made us feel really comfortable. As we are registered with the medical centre downstairs, took a quick nip there to print off our vaccination records. Out in 10 minutes. Great service!"
7845	7845	"Would use them again, quick to get an appointment and the nurse was quick and professional."
7846	7846	"I went for a vaccine, everything went well but the nurse didn't explain side effects. I was in a lot of pain couple of hours later and called the clinic. The receptionist was surprised I haven't been told the side effects and recommended me to see my GP. A nurse was supposed to call me back but never did."
7847	7847	Good advice and quick and efficient service. Thanks.
7848	7848	"Quick efficient service from Kings Cross clinic, having called the same day and getting an appointment that afternoon! - the nurse was also very informative and professional, with the ability to put me at ease - she is a great asset to that clinic, and the main reason I would recommend it to others!"
7849	7849	"1, Very easy booking process 2, Friendly and Supportive stuff Both of the nurses I saw were friendly and provided me with lots of useful information. All my questions got answered. They even helped me locate another clinic in Buenos Aires so I can complete my vaccinations. Thank you London Travel Clinic for your support."
7850	7850	"Went for a acwy vaccine. Nurse was excellent but the receptionist was quite rude and made us feel very uncomfortable. Apart from the receptionist, great place."
7851	7851	"I visited regarding an upcoming trip, and the advice I was given was measured, sensible, pragmatic and relevant, rather than citing information off a 10-yr old government website"
7852	7852	"Brilliant service, simple to book, and Gina was a fantastic nurse administering travel vaccinations to a confirmed needlephobe (didn't feel a thing!)."
7853	7853	The clinic is situated in a central location that's easy to get to. It's great that you can make evening appointments. The facilities are clean and the staff very friendly and professional.
7854	7854	Quick and efficient as well as giving us all the information and making us feel really relaxed and more confident with the vaccinations we may need.
7855	7855	Got quick vaccines and malarlone - handy and not too expensive
7856	7856	It's a bit confusing when you arrive - need 16th floor reception and then go up to 19th floor. Both the receptionist and the nurse were really nice and welcoming. The nurse was very knowledgeable and gave good advice.  Would recommend.
7857	7857	Easy to book system and quick and efficient consultation. Couldn't get through to GP all week and glad I resorted to booking an appointment at the London Travel Clinic and will definitely do so in the future
7858	7858	"I had my appointment yesterday and the nurse who I spoke to has been extremely kind and competent. She gave me all the necessary information I need and she discussed with me  the possible options for the vaccinations I had to do, the pros and cons of some of them, why some others were not necessary for my trip, what should I do in case something happens when I'm abroad, etc. The appointment also began sharply on time.Definitely recommended!"
7859	7859	"Excellent service, quick and efficient. Jabs were very well priced"
7860	7860	"Gina in London Travel Clinic is really nice.She has always been great.Thanks,Cedric"
7861	7861	they didn't keep a record of my previous visits so were of limited help to what I came for. I wanted to verify if I still needed injections but they were unable to locate my previous visit/record with them. so I had to get an injection which may not have been necessary....
7862	7862	I booked at 1750 for an appointment at 0845 following day. Great advice and a very experienced and charming practitioner
7863	7863	Nice and easy. Very friendly and informative staff
7864	7864	I went for my yellow fever jab. Gina was lovely - very welcoming.
7865	7865	I was impressed with the efficient service I received here.
7866	7866	Welcoming and knowledgable nurse. Easy to book and managed to get an appointment the following day.
7867	7867	"Fast, efficient and friendly"
7868	7868	"Same or next day appoitment, you can book your appoitment online very quickly and fill the form that you don't need to do it in clinic. Very friendly personel and quick service :)"
7869	7869	"I've personally had a 10/10 experience with LTC.I chose this clinic because of the web and booking system: quick googling during a pause at work; check the prices online (very important for me), then select a time and traveling countries, give some contact info and that's it: booking set.I received a form to fill out in advance (not mandatory but saved time) and arrived to the clinic 10m in advance. There the nurse was really nice (thank you), most credit cards were accepted (not AMEX, for example, but not my case) and I was out less than 10m after the time of booking: all done."
7870	7870	Great service. Nurse was vert friendly and she was very willing to answer any questions I had about my holiday and made sure I had all the information I needed before I left. Lollipop after my injections meant I relived my childhood. Thank you!
7871	7871	"The nurse I visited took that extra bit of time to make sure I was not undertaking unnecessary treatments that I was already treated for. She was warm, kind and knew clearly what she was doing."
7872	7872	"honestly, great service, great availability for appointments. Went twice, once just to ask some advice, which was helpful, and second for a vaccine. Great bedside manner, and apart from the price tag, was all perfect. quick and simple."
7873	7873	efficient and very nice person and highly knowledgable would def recommend
7874	7874	"I attended the clinic at London Bridge. Quick and efficient service, very professional nurse administrating vaccinations and medical advice given on holiday destinations. Highly recommended.Only downside was the rather rude receptionist on arrival."
7875	7875	Very professional
7876	7876	My experience was very positive. The booking process is very easy and extremely flexible which suits any work schedule. The consultant was really friendly and I was in and out within 10 minutes with all jabs covered. I would definitely go back and recommend this clinic to anyone who needs it.
7877	7877	Jabs for upcoming trip to South and Central America. Booked an appointment for the following day and had necessary jabs there and then. Good knowledge and good service. Would use again.
7878	7878	"Laura was so friendly and helpful, and completely understanding that I am a bit of a fainter. She did her best to ensure I had a laugh, was relaxed, and very well informed about my vaccination and medicinal options. Very grateful to her!"
7879	7879	"I am still in awe with my experience at the London travel clinic.Having been disappointed by Superdrug on the morning of the 7th of October. Been told after arriving at stratford Travel clinic for a booked appointment to be told the nurse was not coming.I was told by a friend to call London Travel Clinic ,which I did and to my surprise I was able to get appointment at the waterloo clinic same day.On getting there The staff were very friendly and professional. Gina is a star.Thank you so much I will use the clinic again and recommend you to people."
7880	7880	"Service on the day was fine, although the prices are extortionate.Disgusted that I called back a month after with pain still in my arm from the injection and they couldn't give a damn. Said its unusual but basically to go and see my doctor. Thanks London Travel Clinc - you're truly awful."
7881	7881	Very welcome and helpful staff !Quick service !Many thanks!
7882	7882	"Unorganised, time wasting experience. One unnessecary trip due to results not being ready when told they were - second trip to get results - only to find stamp run out of ink. Sat around for over an hour while they resolved it. Ridiculous for the price paid."
7883	7883	"I was given the clinic's number from my doctor as I needed jabs and was due to fly in less than a week. I called but was cut off twice, on my third try and getting through I spoke to a very uppity woman who seemed to resent me calling. I made an appointment but the call left a bitter taste so I just didn't turn up."
7884	7884	"Excellent prompt service, helpful knowledgeable staff, a little pricey - but to be expected"
7885	7885	"We took my 20 month old son for his first men b jab at the weekend.  We have already had our 4 year old daughter immunised here as we were told our son may be eligible for immusination under the NHS.  As a result our complain only really lies with the nurse on the day, who did not adequately prepare for giving him the actual injection resulting in us not having him 'restrained' adequately.  As a result he struggled resulting in a bent needle in his thigh and a lot more pain and discomfort than necessary."
7886	7886	"Prompt service when arrived plus very professional and knowledgable nurse, and easily made bookings for follow up inoculations. Whole service throughout from online booking and pre-attendance on line form impressed.Sadly the one thing that frustrated me was the picture test prior to submitting online form - no on screen instructions to explain made it all very unsatisfactory!"
7887	7887	"The service and online page was very impressive and had no problem getting an appointment.I had to rebooked twice,the first operator sound very young and had to repeat everything I said to her (sound foreign) but the second operator sound professional and I had no problem.The Nurse was helpful,advice me correctly but when she start inputting stuff into the computer she had sight problems and didn't had no glasses.God bless her she was helpful.Orginally she said the tablets was cheap but by the time they put vat it became very expensive (I had some old supplies that didn't expire so I was advised to use them and get more before the finished).Overall I would advised to plan ahead and go to your Doctor/Nurse at your local GP.In my opinion I think this service is only applicable to lastminute people dot com lol (you got the drift).Happy travelling ..."
7888	7888	"no missing about, quick polite service"
7889	7889	Appointments are readily available. The advice from the nurse was very helpful and my vaccinations were complete within 15 minutes. It is a great option if you need flexibility and want a no fuss safe solution to your travelling needs.
7890	7890	Very friendly team providing helpful and real information.
7891	7891	"Made the appointment a day before,  quick procedure,  painless,  great knowledge"
7892	7892	Very efficient and friendly
7893	7893	"Easy to book an appointment online at the time I needed. Everyone was very friendly and the nurse was knowledgeable and efficient. A little bit expensive, but comparable to places like Trailfinders. It might be useful to include more information on vaccines on the website. I wasn't meant to eat or drink for an hour beforehand, but wasn't asked about this until I arrived. Luckily I'd checked this on the NHS website earlier that day, but some people might not do this. Overall I would definitely recommend the service to others."
7894	7894	"To be quite honest when I saw the prices of the vaccinations I was a little apprehensive about going to the Travel Clinic. I needed an emergency yellow fever vaccination for my trip to a high risk area in west Africa. The vaccination is live and it requires a minimum of 10 days before travel, I went 6 days before my trip. I got to the London Travel Clinic with ease located right next to Kings Cross station with great transportation options. Got to my appointment 30 minutes early, they have an online form that you fill in before your appointment, takes no time at all and it's handy because the doctor can see your information on screen without the fuss of papers. The appointment before me had not used the online application and was asked to fill there's in and the lovely nurse explained to the young man that she would have to see the next patient whilst he was filling out the form, he was more than happy. I was then ushered into a clean room well organised and situated right at the reception. She double check a few details and she pulled out the vaccine, got the injection which was painless. Prior to that she explained everything that Google could tell you about the vaccine and even went on to suggesting a few other vaccines that would benefit me beyond my travels. In all it was really too good to be true that it was true. I've never experienced absolutely outstanding service, baring in mind all this took only 10 minutes but it felt like an hour with the information I was given. I would recommend this maybe 'only in an emergency' due to the prices, but in hindsight the service was worth it."
7895	7895	"I got the appointment online the night before. Once in the clinic, everything was on time. The service was very friendly and efficient. She recommended me, besides the shots and pills I needed, some visiting spots in the countries I'll be going to. She was very nice about me being scared of needles and made it fast and easy."
7896	7896	"I thought I needed more vaccinations than I did - but rather than make a fast buck, the charming and efficient team explained what I needed and it cost me a fraction of what it might. Booking was easy and I was seen right on time - the staff were a delight and friendly and I shall use them again should I ever need a vaccination."
7897	7897	"Friendly nurse, knew a lot of information to give me and was nice when I nearly fainted!!"
7898	7898	Efficient service with good guidance on what inoculations to have.
7899	7899	"Very straight forward. Seen on time. I arrived expecting to need 4 jabs, and was surprised to be told that two of those would be unnecessary, so the price was very reasonable. Very quick and painless service, in and out in about 10 mins. Will definitely use the service again when required."
7900	7900	I've had two vaccinations for my trip to Sri Lanka and the booking procedure is easy and nurse kind and friendly.
7901	7901	"I have been to the Travel Clinic before and I really loved my experience.  However this one was not great.  First it started off with me being told how busy she was and I felt she really didn't have the time for me. Then I was told 'why are you here you've had vaccinations' in a really unwelcoming manner - but I wanted to talk about anti-malarial, altitude sickness and that my vaccinations might be out of date while I was travelling (as I wasn't entirely sure how long they lasted).  So she went through my list of vaccines saying how long they lasted very rushed so I couldn't keep track and some of them go out of date right at the very end of trip and another had expired but I was told to 'go to my GP', again for the anti-malarial and altitude sickness tablets I was told to 'go to my GP' - because they didn't have and altitude sickness tablets in stock.  And I was told that it must have been larium that I had taken not malarone due to me experiencing hallucinations - but I double checked and this is a uncommon but definitely a side-effect of Malarone.  She later said she was telling me to go to my GP because she thought it would be cheaper - but she didn't know.  I am going away for many months, and would have appreciated a bit more time and consideration.  It was all just a bit weird and confusing."
7902	7902	"I went to get my small child vaccinated against hepatitis a and b, 4 months ahead of a trip to India, and provided all the dates and places ahead of the appointment as well as mentioning them during the appointment.I'd read about twinrix and was comfortable it would protect my child, but wasn't too happy about the 3 injections needed for immunity.So when the nurse showed me the ambarix vaccine and pulled up a comparative online page where it stated that it only required two injections, i asked if my son could have it, and was duly given it.Back at home, i decide to read-up further on the vaccine and discover it only confers immunity after the second injection, at least 6 months after the first one. I.e after our trip. Shouldn't a professional, specialist nurse - as they are advertised online - have informed me of that major drawback before injecting my child with a non-adequate vaccine?If i hadn't read up online after the appointment i might have gone to india thinking my child was protected when he actually wasn't, allowing him more freedom than would ge safe, and risking his health.I'll be asking for my money back."
7903	7903	"Could not fault this experience in any way. Quick, friendly, efficient. The nurse was charming and extremely informative - lovely guy. I would thoroughly recommend"
7904	7904	"Waterloo clinic:Free consultation genuinely felt like no strings attached advice. Nurse clearly knew what she was talking about (also from idle conversation with her found out she'd recently attended a tropical diseases conference, so she clearly keeps her knowledge up to date too). Was a fast and simple process, no complications, and I was able to book an appointment for later that day straight after work.Only negative point is I struggled to book an appointment on my phone (running iOS 9) because the Captcha thing kept not working. But it worked fine on my laptop."
7905	7905	"I needed to get immunisations quickly and was glad to discover the London Travel Clinic. I liked the ability to make appointments and fill out the forms online. On the day, the nurse talked me through what I needed and what I didn't. Quick and easy."
7906	7906	"I just needed one of my three rabies shots yesterday and I found the clinic easy to find, their online services including appointment reminders and the pre-exam online forms were clear and easy to fill out. The actual appointment was quick and punctual and I was impressed with a very professional atmosphere. Good place."
7907	7907	"I was a bit concerned about having an allergic reaction to the vaccines; the nurse picked up on me being anxious and she thought I was afraid of the tiny needles so she started asking me about my trip, to distract me, like they do for kids. I found that hilarious so I just rolled with it.Long story short, the nurse was very friendly and professional.10/10 Would get dead viruses pumped up my arm again."
7908	7908	"We met with a lovely nurse, she explained everything very easily and even made us save money. I was a bit apprehensive going in but she really made me feel safe and infirmed before any proceeding."
7909	7909	"I've attended the clinic to get vaccines for my upcoming trip to South America with my girlfriend. We've been thoroughly walked through what shots we would need, if we go to malaria risk areas, checked if any of our current medication would have a conflict with the vaccines. We've been advised also that a GP might be cheaper solution if they have travel clinic. The nurse was really friendly, really nice person. A lovely human service. I'd recommend this clinic to anyone."
7910	7910	"Had to have 2 injections for an upcoming trip - nurse was incredibly thorough making sure I knew all necessary information and gave great advice re mosquitos, insect repellant etc. Very reassuring and the injections themselves were 99% painless. Only drawback was arriving at location, stepped out of the lift and the doors out of the lift-lobby were all locked, waited 5 minutes before a cleaner came past who let me in. The clinic itself is in a small office inside a large office block. Not what I was expecting, and feels like a slightly odd place to be receiving injections, but overall it certainly does the job. Would recommend to anyone needing vaccinations."
7911	7911	Easy to book. Quick and helpful service. Will use again.
7912	7912	"I'd left my vaccinations quite late for my trip to SE Asia, I booked an appointment online and was seen within a couple of days. The service was very efficient and friendly and all of the questioned were answered leaving me with peace of mind about my trip. Definitely recommended."
7913	7913	Anna was very knowledgeable and pleasant. Very quick service! Will use again.
7914	7914	"I am scared of needles but Nalini made me feel very at ease. She talked me through what I needed and definitely calmed me down. And guess what? It didn't hurt! Knowledgable,  very professional and friendly service. I'd recommend. Thank you London Travel Clinic. Pip"
7915	7915	"I was not told at any point before the nurse was about to give me an injection that it would cost. The GP, phone operator and Receptionist did not mention I'd pay ?50 for a jab which is free at the GP.The nurse was very dismissive and was annoyed that I was surprised! They also got my email address wrong twice so I couldn't find the first appointment I made (at Victoria - so hard to find and then there was no receptionist!)"
7916	7916	Really sensible and helpful advice - especially for a trip where I'll be travelling around quite a bit in a region I've never been to before. Quick and easy to get an appointment - would definitely recommend this service to friends and family.
7917	7917	"Calm, considered, and seemingly very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend. Will be going back for more information on malaria requirements when I have decided more about what I'm doing."
7918	7918	"My girlfriend and I had to get vaccinations for travelling to colombia and our nurse ??despite us being over 5 minutes late?? was excellent, quick, and concise, giving us all the information we needed including providing us with the correct vaccines. My girlfriend is also very afraid of needles, and she said that her experience was the best she had ever had and hardly felt it at all. While being concise in the appointment, the nurse also managed to avoid glossing over things but still provide us with all the information we needed before we went away."
7919	7919	Cheerful and quick. Thank you
7920	7920	Great experience. Easy to book. Extremely friendly nurse and I was done with the appointment within 15 minutes!
7921	7921	"It was thecfirst time we had used the clinic, we were a little nervous but the receptionist (Marella?) was reassuring and helpful , the medical staff were very professional. The whole experience was great , quick and we will definately use the clinic again."
7922	7922	Straight forward no nonsense clinic.  Nurse was very friendly. I would recommend to anyone.
7923	7923	"The doctor was very helpful, providing all the information I required for my trip. I was in and out within the space of 20 minutes."
7924	7924	"Wow, such a quick, personal and professional service. I was seen on time, my requirements were discussed, the actions explained and carried out all within 10 minutes. SJ"
7925	7925	Very quick and painless vaccination service.
7926	7926	"Very friendly and knowledgeable. Made you feel at ease (probably in case people have injection fears!). A very quick process, in and out in about 5 minutes!"
7927	7927	"My wife and I realised rather late we needed some vaccinations for a trip abroad, so we booked an appointment straightaway and got all the advice and vaccinations we needed in 15 minutes flat. Excellent professional attention and no-nonsense service, all at a reasonable price."
7928	7928	Great guy Richard did the whole family ( 5 of us ) and was really helpful and knowledgeable . Speed and access to appointments excellent. Only issue was the price ! 10 injections ( two for each of hte family ) equals ?600 !!
7929	7929	"No one on reception when we arrived and had to phone another company in the building to get in. Once in though the experience was good. Quick and efficient service by the doctor, good travel advice."
7930	7930	"Service was really friendly, informed and professional"
7931	7931	A shame that I wasn't made aware of the price of injections. The two I had I should have got for free from my local GP and did not have to pay ?94. Just a shame really. The woman was really nice though.
7932	7932	"I needed to get Hepatitis B vaccine done in advance of travelling.  As it's only 6 weeks till I depart I wasn't sure if I could be vaccinated and have immunity before I departed.   So I called the phone line listed on their website (02035530018).   The person who answered was particularly unhelpful giving very short dismissive answers to my questions.  Here is how the conversation went:Me : ""Hi, I am travelling in 6 weeks time, how long is the course of vaccinations for Hepatitis B?""Lady : ""It takes 3 months""Me: ""ok, so is there any point in me starting the vaccination dosages now so that I can have immunity for my holiday?""Lady: ""No, you will not have full immunity until the 3 months of vaccinations are completed"".Me: ""ok then, I guess there's no point in me getting it then""Lady:   no reply just silence.Me: ""em, ok then, thanks and good bye""I was quite taken back with both the attitude and the information I received, as my GP was under the impression that I should be able to get vaccinated in time.Thankfully I went ahead and booked an appointment at their London Bridge clinic anyway for that day.   Going to the clinic was a very positive experience - I was told my options including one where I could get a dose that day, another one a month after, and then a final one after I return from my trip, and that this would give me immunity during my holiday.   The jab was done quickly and without pain (just a slightly sore arm afterwards)  So I would highly recommend their service, but I was disappointed by their assistance on the phone line, giving me incorrect information which could well have resulted in me not getting this vaccination.    I wanted to email London Travel Clinic to tell them about this, but I could not find a contact email address anywhere on their site, hence I decided to mention this issue in my feedback here in the hope that someone from the company will see it and ensure that their phone line team have all the accurate information to hand about Hep B vaccination time lines."
7933	7933	"Quick, no ques, convenient, easy and close to the station. Friendly nurse who looked after me well."
7934	7934	"First time visitor to London Travel Clinic. Appointment was on time, quick and efficient. Doctor/nurse was thorough in her briefing, explaining requirements and side effects. Very easy process"
7935	7935	I only went to a private travel clinic because my GP surgery has lost its nurse so I was forced to go private. I was wary of going to private place because I thought they'd load me up with unnecessary shots to get me to spend more money but the nurse was very pro and went through my vaccination history (which I brought with me) and only advised I get 1 shot.
7936	7936	"Professional, informative, friendly and convenient. Cannot fault the London Travel Clinic (London Bridge) in any way. With private medical providers I am sometimes worried about the potential for 'up-selling' to make more money. The London Travel clinic is the exact opposite offering impartial, informative advice and always looking for the best option for the patients (from both a health and cost perspective - include offering advice if something may be available on prescription from a local GP).Would highly recommend."
7937	7937	"Needed some vaccinations last minute and they had a clinic close to my office, the online booking and patient questionnaire were easy to use. The nurse who I saw was helpful and friendly."
7938	7938	"Great service when we were finally let in to the Oxford  St clinic - stood outside for 10mins - no sign, no one responding, no one there and nearly went home. Receptionist arrived late then it was all OK - bit hit and miss though as we'd travelled a long way"
7939	7939	"I was a pain, as I'd already had HepA+B and Typhoid injections in my left arm that day, but requested my rabies vac in my left too, as exams are coming up and my right arm needs to be pristine! The lovely nurse at kings cross did that and there were no issues.I was informed about follow-ups and possible (though unlikely) side effects. The nurse was really friendly and approachable. If I had any concerns, I would've felt comfortable sharing them with her.Really pleased with the service, and it was at a really good price too."
7940	7940	"Great experience with them, it was simple, quick (was in and out in just over 5 mins!), and they took the time to inform me of everything I needed to know (and didn't hurry me or get annoyed at my questions!).Was also a touch cheaper than their main competitor. Definitely recommend."
7941	7941	"I can't recommend this place enough. I've been walking around my whole life having a massive fear of needles and hospitals. Going to the travel clinic for my vaccinations before going on holiday was the best experience, my nurse was so lovely, they don't have to wear uniform so it felt super relaxed and I was done in under 5 minutes from exerting the room. I've never had such a great experience having injections done. I'm so happy I went and I'll recommend anyone to go! Than you so much."
7942	7942	Xxxxxxxxxxxxx
7943	7943	"We were very well looked after by Richard at the Kings Cross branch. As a family undertaking our first big adventure in Borneo with kids aged 8, 10 and 12, Richard patiently explained the jabs we'd need, discussed other jabs that we could consider taking, and gave other useful and sensible advice in a calm, professional atmosphere. I thoroughly recommend the London Travel Clinic."
7944	7944	Great quality of care. Top nurse.  Shame that the single injection cost ?20 more than at Boots. Unlikely I'll head back.
7945	7945	"I've used their services more than once and will continue to do so. Easy to book appointments, no long hours in waiting rooms and you can get sorted to travel on very short notice. Excellent service!"
7946	7946	This was the worst experience I have ever had in heath care. The nurse (Anastasia) was unbelievably rude throughout the whole appointment. She rushed the consultation and was speaking so fast we could barley understand her. If we had a query about a vaccination we were treated like idiots (as if we are supposed to know every thing about travel vaccinations !) We were given no time to consider what jabs we wanted and rushed into making a decision then quickly stabbed with needles and had a card machine shoved into my face for payment before scribbling illegible nonsense on a log book and shoved out the door so the next appointment could come in. DO NOT USE THIS CLINIC IT IS HORRIFIC !!!!!!!!
7947	7947	"Above says it all really.  Googled, vaccinations for India, came up with the Travel Clinic.  Locations were really convenient for commuters, plenty of appointments, online form completion so when I arrived was in and out within 10 minutes.  Shall definitely use them again when I have a need."
7948	7948	"I had a very good experience with the LTC. I was greeted by name as I entered, I didn't have to wait long before going in and the Nurse was very friendly. There was good chat and asked the questions that I expected to be asked about my travels. I was out swiftly as well, although I expect if I had more questions she would have spared the time if needed.Thanks"
7949	7949	"I went on two seperate days, one for the conceltation and one for my vaccinations. the lady i was met by at the reception and who was treating me were both very rude and short with me, they didn't explain that they were running behind schedule, offer me a drink or act particularly nicely. the doctor didn't discuss my options very clearly, and instead just told me what to do.i assumed then that this is just how travel clinics where, it was only the next time i went i realised how kind this new set of staff were. A man at the reception was welcoming and offered me a drink straight away, he told me they were running slightly behind and to make myself comfy, really friendly and really nice. The doctor this time, shook my hand and had a really nice conversation with me about where i was travelling, properly talking through my options and what i should get, making it a good price and just what i needed for my trip. it would be great if all the staff were as nice as the second time i visited."
7950	7950	My appointment was bang on time and the doctor I saw was knowledgeable and efficient.
7951	7951	I did not have to wait for much time in the waiting room and the nurse was very friendly and informative. He explained the risks and benefits of the vaccines and adminstered them during the appointment. The price for HepA + Typhoid was ?95 which was pretty decent compared to other travel clinics that I saw. All in all it was a good experience.
7952	7952	"Highly recommend the London Travel Clinic, the nurse was very professional, friendly and explained everything very clearly. Will be going back again should I need further shots."
7953	7953	"Providing the online information meant the nurse was fully briefed and it took 5 mins to administer the necessary vaccinations and then ready to go! Very easy, quick and efficient!"
7954	7954	"Overall the doctor I met with was friendly, informative and quick. So I am more than happy with the service. Although it was expensive!"
7955	7955	"London Travel Clinic provides an excellent informative service - the whole process was very quick and easy. They can even allocate same day appointments - extremely helpful, and very friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone planning on getting vaccinations."
7956	7956	Great nurse who really knew her stuff and had me sorted and ready to travel to South Sudan in the space of a 15 min appointment. Thx
7957	7957	Good friendly efficient service. Recommended.
7958	7958	Everything is just great and the best!
7959	7959	Very good service. I did not feel pressurised in any vaccination.  Knowledgeable Nurse with a warm approach. Highly recommended
7960	7960	"Very convenient, informative and quick. Helpful advice by a friendly Doctor."
7961	7961	"I found the clinic to be very clean, the service speedy, and the nurse was very knowledgeable. I felt like she had a lot of time for me, and made my options clear without pressuring me to get my vaccinations that day or choose an expensive option. Making an appointment was also very easy and I was able to make an appointment for a time that suited me within the next week."
7962	7962	"Extremely knowledgeable, and helpful. Would definitely recommend for travel vaccines."
7963	7963	"Booking an appointment was extremely easy with their website. They have many appointments available. The nurse was very helpful, took time to explain everything. Will definitely go back if need to."
7964	7964	"Booked online 2 days before, was seen 5 mins before the start time and had jabs done and tablets in hand within 10 mins. Couldn't ask for a simpler, faster service"
7965	7965	Was seen within 5 minutes of my appointment time.  Nurse was professional and friendly and very efficient.
7966	7966	"I like the clinic, people who is working there, but we didnt get any explanation about side effects which can happen after vaccine.. I wrote my alergies and after vaccine i got side effects, i got alergy huge one and in the morning i couldnt get properly the help from the clinic, just they kept to say that i will call me soon and i was waiting long time. when i called for emergency they told that 2 vaccinations for two week holiday it is too much for my body."
7967	7967	--------------
7968	7968	"Wasn't just trying to sell me vaccinations for the sake of it, honest and friendly service"
7969	7969	"I have used twice this service 3 years ago and the other day for update of what was needed for my trip booked online appointment confirmed via emal  went for my appointment seen on time had a very warm welcome had my injection needed very happy witht the service I will use again on my next trip many thanks,"
7970	7970	"Location, online booking and pricing are really great for last minute trips. The nurse  I saw was super rude though, she did not explain much and spoke very little and was super curt. She clearly wanted me out of her office as quickly as possible and when. I asked for recommendations she snapped at mein I hadn't read the website about what is recommended for my destination (it was not clear from the website though, hence my visit). If the professionalism of the treating staff would match everything else this would be a traveller.s dream come true."
7971	7971	The doctor was so patient with our children thank you
7972	7972	"its really great as save my time as nurse is very nice person,as don't feel i am in a clinic as feel as at home best hygiene ,excellent service and quick i strongly recommend who like to travel or need vaccine than don't go to gp in future i love to be their when need 100% satisfaction"
7973	7973	"I have very little trust in my care-giver. I mentioned that I thought that one of the areas I was going had malaria, and asked whether I needed anti-malarials.I was pretty firmly told that nowhere in the region has malaria.I said that I was pretty sure Vanuatu had malaria.He checked, and indeed Vanuatu has malaria.I have no confidence in this travel clinic at all, after I was firmly told I didn't need treatment which I did in fact need. I'm glad I happened to have sufficient knowledge in advance."
7974	7974	"Quick, reliable, well informed, overall good service"
7975	7975	"Simple & professional service, book or phone, attend, be seen, at very reasonable rates.outstanding service, highly recommended."
7976	7976	Did an internet search on a Saturday for my son to have his jabs for a last minute holiday called up and got an appointment for a few hours later!!!
7977	7977	Very easy to book appointment online and fill in pre-questionnaire to save time. Was seen 15 minutes early and everything was great.
7978	7978	I can't fault the service from London Travel Clinic. I booked an appointment online at the Waterloo clinic and was able to change it easily to a later time over the phone.I was seen without delay and the nurse was informative and helpful about what vaccinations I needed for my destination countries. (It helped that I had a record of my vaccinations so do find out and take this along if you can.) The consultation is free and I then paid for one injection. It would have been impossible to be seen at my GP in the time I had available. I will definitely be using London Travel Clinic again.
7979	7979	"While it was quite hard to find the clinic in Waterloo I did manage to get there eventually! I was initially taken aback by how small it was, but do not let that deceive you! They were super quick and helpful and the nurse knew exactly what vaccinations I would need for my trip. I didn't feel like they were pushing me to have a load of unnecessary vaccinations, but just the minimum, with information about the other ones I might like to consider. I would definitely use them again."
7980	7980	I'm petrified of needles and the nurse put me at ease immediately. He explained all of the jabs and tablets I'd need and the reasons why (as well as their cost) - it was a very transparent process.I also didn't have much time and this was perfect - I was in and out in less than 20 minutes.
7981	7981	"Were happy to move my appointment forward, very friendly staff. Only thing is I'm still a bit confused about Doxy vs Malarone but I think maybe there's no right or wrong answer."
7982	7982	"Punctual with appointment in a convenient location and a comfortable, well appointed office. Knowledgeable practitioner Kerry provided expert advice on travel vaccinations for South east Asia tailored to my specific situation, including the options open to me and she was very reassuring in the process  -  I hardly felt the jabs as well, so that was a bonus!"
7983	7983	"The booking process was quick, easy and flexible with a wide range of locations, morning and evening appointments and online booking tool. Convenient location, about a minute from the Liverpool Street underground exit. Very friendly and professional, knowledgeable and practical staff. Will definitely use again in future and would recommend to all."
7984	7984	"Easy to book on their website, nurse was very professional, gave me lots of advice about vaccinations in general and all the admin was painless (as was the injection). Would recommend."
7985	7985	Great service
7986	7986	"Appointment booking is very simple, appointments available at times to suit, very slick process. Excellent service and very reassuring ... Couldn't recommend this highly enough."
7987	7987	"I went to the Oxford Street branch for a Hepatitis A vaccination and I am very pleased with the service. The nurse, Farzana, was gentle and professional. I didn't even feel the sting of the needle when she injected the vaccine!My arm is a bit achy now, but she warned me about it, so I have nothing to complain about."
7988	7988	The person who advised me was very honest and clear explaining me everything.
7989	7989	"Friendly, personal and fast - love the Liverpool Street branch"
7990	7990	The person who greeted me and gave me my vaccine shots was very friendly and professional ! It was a pleasure and I won't hesitate to go back and recommend the Clinic to anyone ! Thank you !
7991	7991	"Quick,  efficient..you name it!!  I visited your clinic on Friday and the customer service was absolutely fantastic!  I couldn't contact my GP to get my immunization records and the receptionist did that for me! She saved me time and money! , the  nurse Anna  was also very sweet considering my needle phobia!, overall very impressed and would recommend!"
7992	7992	"This was very good indeed. Sound advice and very reassuring, gave me confidence as to my planned trip to Asia.Would certainly recommend this service, no question about it."
7993	7993	"I attended an appointment on the 9th March 2016 at the Victoria branch of the London Travel Clinic. Before going on to the various issues I encountered in that appointment let me start off by saying I needed an urgent Yellow Fever vaccination as I was travelling in 3 days.  I was able to book an appointment online very quickly and at a convenient time. The confirmation and further notifications were helpful and arrived in a timely matter. Sadly that is where the positive feedback ends.So I arrived at the Porterhouse Building at my scheduled appointment time , having phoned up the clinic to get specific instructions just before my appointment. As that building had a guest pass system I was required to wait for the 7 people in front of me to obtain their passes before I was given mine to allow me entry into the building. (The reason for this detail will become apparent as you read on). This process took 10mins, as the people in front of me had difficulties explaining to the sole receptionist, whom they were there to visit.  My Guest pass finally obtained and gates opened, I proceeded to the 19th Level , where I found that the doors were locked. I again telephoned the clinic to say I was now outside the clinic but still couldnt obtain entry. I was advised to wait where I was for 5mins and someone would be along to collect me. So now, by no fault of my own I am now 15 mins late for my scheduled appointment. A young gentleman came to open the door and I immediately informed him of my frustration at having to spend 15 mins just getting into the building. In any event he took me to a waiting room where in the adjoining room was the nurse practitioner. He informed her that I was here and I could hear her loudly respond that she would not be seeing me as I was late for the appointment. Needless to say I piped up and from where I was sitting informed her that I had actually been on the telephone to the clinic downstairs of the building at my scheduled time and relaying the difficulties that I had encountered. This nurse took no notice of anything that I had said and was still bemoaning the fact that I was late and I would have to reschedule. The gentleman closed the door to the adjoining room (I believe to prevent me hearing any further dialogue between them) however this nurses voice was still raised and I could hear the unprofessional comments she was making. When the said gentleman returned to the waiting room,  he provided me with a form that I was to fill out and when I expressed to him that I would be unable to reschedule as I was travelling in 3 days time he indicated that I should complete the form quickly and he would get her ( the nurse ) to see me.  In hindsight I wish I had left the building at that juncture and found somewhere else to pay for the vaccination that I needed. Anyway, I completed the form and he told me to enter the adjoining room. Upon entering, the nurse, whose name I saw to be Celine, from the name badge she was wearing, did not say hello but rather told me that I was late and that she had another client expected in two minutes. (No-one else had entered the waiting room whilst I was completing the form and indeed there was no one else waiting after the disastrous  appointment had ended).  I told her that I required a yellow fever vaccination and as we were both pressed for time lets get on with it. She clearly took umbrage at that statement, as then she proceeded to tell me that she would go thru a full consultation with me to determine what it was I did or did not need. I made it clear, that the only vaccination I needed (having been specifically advised by a medic and had written confirmation by the company I was travelling with) was the yellow fever so trying to get me to get other vaccinations was pointless and a waste of both our times. She then went into a tirade that she had been doing this work for over 40 or 60 years (cant remember now which of those numbers she used as I was so angry at this point) and that she wouldnt be giving me the yellow fever if she didnt feel it necessary. I then told her I had been specifically told that I wouldnt be able to travel if I hadnt received the yellow fever and was getting the email which stated the same, to show to her when she said she didnt care. She knew what she was doing and wouldnt be giving me that vaccination willy nilly. At this stage I was dumbfounded. Her tone and language was demeaning, belittling and unprofessional.  She asked me for a list of the countries I was due to be visiting and I gave them to her,  to which she then concluded she WASN??T going to give me the vaccination but rather an exemption certificate. For another 5 minutes a heated exchange took place with the both of us raising our voices, as I was flabbergasted,  that a vaccination I knew I had to have and was PAYING for privately was being denied to me because this profoundly rude nurse practitioner felt like it. I was again trying to show her the email from the company which stated I MU"
7994	7994	They have lots of available appointments which makes it very convenient. I didn't have to wait at all either of the times I was there. The nurse was lovely and she did a great job when applying the vaccine! Highly recommend.
7995	7995	"Venue was easy to find, staff very professional and friendly."
7996	7996	"Great advice, quick convenient service - just what was needed."
7997	7997	"Friendly staff, quick appointment. Nurse was very knowledgeable. Building was a bit tricky to find though (no signs just inside a glass office block) so look it up before you go!"
7998	7998	Really good treatment and very efficient system. The nurse gave excellent advice on which vaccinations to take based on my travel plans.
7999	7999	"Attended with husband and children for consultation prior to trip to Nigeria. Thorough consultation, even checked the children's red books. We weren't pressured into having anything we didn't want and were even directed back to our GP for Hep A and typhoid on the NHS. Good advice given as well on keeping safe."
8000	8000	"10/10 recommend.  Great location, easy to find, very helpful and informative nurse and everything was done in 10 minutes."
8001	8001	"Excellent, accurate and fast service at many locations in London."
8002	8002	"I hate needles and was dreading this. I had a trip to India and needed the jabs. I turned up at the Soho office and was quickly seen, The nurse gave a quick, clear and honest opinion about the jabs I should have and swiftly proceeded with the innoculations.I was surprised at the speed and profincy but most of all how pain free it was. I left with a smile on my face knowing I was covered by my trip.I also got a sweetie from reception on the ground floor.Injections aren't complete without having a sweetie for being brave."
8003	8003	Lynda was excellent - very efficient and knowledgeable. A bit pricy but prepared to pay for the convenience. I would recommend to others.
8004	8004	"Though I was getting vaccinations I found the experience very pleasant. I loved that I could book ahead via the website, so that there was no waiting around and the nurse who vaccinated me was very friendly and great for a laugh. She was also informative and made sure I was comfortable, making sure I was aware of what I was being injected with by showing me the vaccine's before going ahead. Good place all around if you're looking to get vaccinated before you're travels :)"
8005	8005	"I have a real phobia of needles, avoiding at all costs since fainting in school a number of times. After finally plucking up the courage to go with my fianc?? ahead of our Sri Lanka honeymoon (after cancelling one appointment!) I found myself incredibly nervous upon arrival. The nurse was incredibly understanding, accommodating and most importantly QUICK as I insisted. I then proceeded to faint. I awoke panicked a few moments later to the same nurse who helped me recover, reassured me and made sure I was Ok to leave. Although not a personally great experience, the service and help, I cannot fault. Thank you very much, I hope you get to see this review. I appreciate it very much."
8006	8006	"Highly recommended, team were very professional and I was seen within a minute of arriving for my appointment, which was easy to book online, with multiple locations across London. I'd had a range of jabs a few years before and the nurse identified the ones I didn't need to have again for my upcoming trip to India. Good value for money too compared to some other travel clinics I've used before, will use as my only travel clinic from now on."
8007	8007	"Easy to book & appointments available for the same day. The nurse I saw was knowledgeable about the locations I was travelling and provided good, unbiased advice on the precautions to take. Overall very impressed & would recommend."
8008	8008	"Nurse was superbly informed about every country, extremely efficient as well as being very pleasant, the office was not sign posted and you needed reading glasses to fill in the patient form on the IPad, Bit pricy but everything available  and at short notice."
8009	8009	"It's great, right up there, (on the 17th floor)."
8010	8010	"Excellent clinic. clean, quick and central location. Staff were great also with me not liking injections!"
8011	8011	"The nurse was really helpful and gave me lots of extra travel advice. Quick, fuss-free appointment."
8012	8012	"We talked to the nurse about our trip to Burma for which we thought we needed  Japanese encephalitis and rabies vaccinations. After discussing our trip with the nurse, we decided just to have the encephalitis injection. At no time was there any pressure to buy anything from the travel clinic. The nurse was knowledgeable, attentive and competent. I would definitely recommend this clinic."
8013	8013	The nurse who saw me was extremely helpful and well informed.  On top of which despite the consultation being free she did not push me to buy any London Travel Clinic products (in the end I did but without her prompting) - I would definitely use them again - including for fee paying services like immunisation.
8014	8014	Friendly and efficient service. I was in and out of there in a flash.
8015	8015	"The nurse was really helpful, quick and efficient. I was in and out in no time and all sorted for my trip."
8016	8016	"Great service - I was greeted warmly and the nurse was extremely friendly, offering lots of useful advice. I would highly recommend."
8017	8017	"I arrived, filled out my forms online to speed the process of ""paperwork"" along, was called back into the room to receive my shots in a very painless and efficient manner.  The staff was exceptionally kind and knowledgeable and went above and beyond.  I would go there again."
8018	8018	"Appointment yesterday evening with Lynda, am a nervous patient re needles and she was calm and reassuring. Normally find vaccinations painful but didn't feel a thing, have recommended clinic to friends already. Prices reasonable and good location near to station. Will definitely use their services in future."
8019	8019	I will definitely recommend family and friends to the clinic
8020	8020	"Quick and easy, once you have navigated your way to their office!"
8021	8021	London Travel Clinic provided a quick and supportive service from first touch point to consultation. This made it really easy and put my mind at rest to what vaccination I required and were all completed on the day of enquiry. Good price and highly recommended.
8022	8022	Friendly and professional service. Would certainly recommend.
8023	8023	"My travel nurse was honest, upfront and professional. I would recommend them 100%"
8024	8024	"Couldn't get an appointment at my GP. Booked at 8pm for 12:30pm the next day, got there are 12:15pm and was out by 12:20!"
8025	8025	"I was travelling to India and needed three injections. Unfortunately I was too late to use the local GP as I hadn't registered so had to use London Travel Clinic. Their service was very good, and although they were late to see me, they were very apologetic.The Nurse I had seemed very knowledgeable and gave great all round travel/health advice which was refreshing to hear. My only gripe was the price. I paid ?125 for my three jabs and in comparison to the NHS which was free for my wife, it makes for an expensive addition to our holiday. Having said that, the added convenience of the appointments and the very specialist knowledge I received, I recommend them if you're not registered with a doctor or in a hurry."
8026	8026	"Quick, efficient, friendly and personal service. Good alternatives were given for allergies I have. Would definitely go back for any future vaccinations."
8027	8027	"Was seen to on time, the nurse was very friendly and very professional. Talked me through all the options and made the whole process and quick and easy and possible. At other travel clinics I've felt like they've tried to persuade me to have jabs I didn't really need which made me feel uncomfortable and ripped off. Here the nurse gave me honest advise about what I needed and what I didn't. Would 100% recommend and will definitely be back again."
8028	8028	"It was all very quick and easy, lovely cheerful nurse, easy to book and very accessible. Thoroughly recommend.  Will use again."
8029	8029	"I went to the clinic in Waterloo. The lady was friendly and helpful and clearly knew what she was doing. However, there was no mention of the fee on the website, and it was surprisingly expensive for a jab. It's dishonest of them not to list prices. They bank on the fact that people are desperate for last minute jabs. Also, AVOID if you're trying to get a prescription for anti-malaria treatments, they do not issue them, rather, they sell you the pills directly at an extortionate mark  up."
8030	8030	Speedy efficient knowledgeable and friendly service
8031	8031	"Extremely rude person gave me my vaccination, absolutely no help at all in terms of advice. I may as well have used google."
8032	8032	"The nurse didn't sterilize the area before giving the injection. This is hygiene one-o-one. The area could have come in contact with bacteria or virus and when pushing in the needle, those bactera/virus could be introduced directly into the bloodstream. It's hugely inappropriate not to sterilize the area. Points to severe quality defects. I would never go again.PS: As for the reply, thank you for your corporate-speak. It speaks volumes."
8033	8033	"Amazng service, and Jane at London Travel Clinic was exceptionally helpful. Thank you."
8034	8034	"Easy, had time for me when it suited me, quick and efficient. More expensive than some other travel clinics, and of course, more than the NHS, but I can no longer get an appointment at my local GP for travel vaccinations, so this is the only real choice. In that light, recommended."
8035	8035	"Very pleased with my appointment at London Bridge Travel Clinic. When I arrived the receptionist knew me by name and was friendly and welcoming. My appointment started on time, and was with a friendly and helpful chap who went through the vaccinations clearly. I felt comfortable and at ease the whole time. Thoroughly recommend the Clinic."
8036	8036	Booked and appointment for same day. Turned up several hours early as I was in the area - hoping for a cancellationThere was !Forms filled - advice given - vaccination completed All in 20 minutesGreat teamThanks
8037	8037	"Was very easy to book online.  Was seen very quickly upon arrival, the nurse was friendly and gave plenty of information about the vaccinations and other precautions for my trip to Thailand."
8038	8038	"I waited in reception. When the nurse came through the receptionis pointed at me and said "" the one with the hat "" I was then taken through to the nurse visit. I found the meeting very rushed, undetailed and at times incorrect. I had to go over the number of injections needed per vaccinnation as the advice was not clear. It was all very rushed and lacking any customer service."
8039	8039	"I needed a vaccination to use it at the US Embassy. The nurse was great and friendly. After having received the vaccine, which was a very straightforward process, I received what they call 'vaccination card'. I kindly asked for a headed letter confirming my vaccination to give it to the embassy. The nurse, Tara, was really helpful but unfortunately the computer she was using didn't have WORD installed so she could not give me a headed letter. After having called her manager she informed me that she was not able to do it and that they would have to speak with other branches where they could possibly do it (computers had WORD installed). On top of that, I was informed that the manager said it would be an additional cost of ?15. Really??? For a piece of paper confirming you have had a vaccination there is a hidden cost which is nowhere to be found in the website? And what sort of healthcare business dealing with such things doesn't consider WORD is an essential piece of software to run on your fancy MAC.I thanked the nurse (it was not her fault really).It is a bit harsh though having this sort of treatment from a clinic that is supposed to provide healthcare services."
8040	8040	Title says it all
8041	8041	"The all experience was much easier than expected. the booking online was very straight forward. There are a lot of clinics distributed through London, so it is very convenient. We were taken in even before our time. The nurse was professional, friendly and very helpful. All the information we needed was provided to us. Overall a very good experience apart from the needle."
8042	8042	"The doctor I saw took the time to ask about my travel and medical history, looked at my itinerary and recommend the most appropriate vaccinations. Very good."
8043	8043	Super friendly and informative staff.Great experience over all.
8044	8044	"Easy booking system, on-time appointment and friendly efficient service - can't ask for more."
8045	8045	Only ever used the London Travel Clinic (London Bridge and Liverpool St branches) for anti-malarials but they also always been very efficient and nice - beats trying to get an appointment at the GP
8046	8046	"It was simple, quick and easy to book an appointment with London Travel Clinic. Upon arrival I was seen promptly by friendly, experienced and knowledgeable staff. I would recommend the London Travel Clinic highly."
8047	8047	My wife and I booked the appointments last week using the website which was simple and we received confirmations via email plus reminders by sms which was great. The location of the clinic was perfect for us and the service we received was great. We were seen on time by a very professional and helpful nurse who advised us on the vaccinations and precautions to consider for our upcoming trip. We had the combined typhoid / hepatitis A jab and bought some anti mosquitoes sprays. We decided to the clinic as we contacted our GP surgery and the process would take at least 2 visits and the price of the treatment wasn't significantly less. We would thoroughly recommend the clinic and will certainly use it again in the future.
8048	8048	I highly recommend this centre for vaccinations and information of any sort before your trip.The employee are well prepared and really helpful.
8049	8049	"I was working in London and needed to get my yellow fever jab for my upcoming trip to South America (others were done at my doctors surgery). Booking was easy, easy to find, very friendly man greeted me and the travel specialist nurse was also really friendly. She explained some of my other options and also gave me some other travel advice to help keep me healthy whilst I am away."
8050	8050	"People were lovely at the London Travel Clinic.The only thing is finding the place as it is hosted by Regus and they occupy only a small office.It's on the 19th floor (receptionnist told me 16th floor ahah). Room 1915a (it was left for me out of the elevators but it depends on which one you use of course)Get into Regus offices, left, and it's a couple of offices on the left.Enjoy."
8051	8051	"Extremely polite and approachable nurse, very patient with my 3 year old. took the time to explain everything clearly to us. Pricey as compared to other travel clinics, but we were given an appointment immediately on request, unlike other clinics. Location was convenient as well"
8052	8052	"My appointment was for vaccinations before heading to Central America, the nurse I had was absolutely lovely and the injection smooth & pain free! I was offered lots of information on diseases I might encounter, such as rabies, and what to do in case of exposure. All in all it was a fine experience - very happy :)"
8053	8053	"I can't fault the service experience I had with Travel Clinic, and I'm notoriously difficult to please, so is my 2yo son that didn't even cry. I'm not going anywhere else. Long live Travel Clinic."
8054	8054	"I attended the clinic with my boyfriend,for our forthcoming trip to Africa.The receptionist was welcoming and all details once we arrived were handled efficiently and on time.The nurse administering our yellow fever vaccine was calm,reassuring and superlative in her expertise .The experience was painless and positive.My only suggestion was that when I booked the appointments online,at first I was given the incorrect date and time -different to what I had requested.When I tried to ring to speak to someone,I tried numerous times and absolutely couldn't get through.So I finally was able to book an earlier date again online,and cancel the later date in person.One other tiny point is that it isn't obvious from the outside of the building ,that it is the clinic .Perhaps it would be helpful to have a sign outside."
8055	8055	"I needed a yellow fever injection and i booked for the next day, the office is very convenient next to Liverpool street and the nurse/dr very knowledgable and friendly - I would recommend and use again myself if needed. Thank you"
8056	8056	Using the London Travel Clinic was great. It was easy to book online and i didn't have to wait very long for an available appointment. At the actual appointment everyone was extremely helpful and the injections themselves were quick and painless. I would definitely go back and recommend to others.
8057	8057	I needed a vaccination at very short notice and was able to get an appointment with a few hours.The Clinic was easy to find and was in a great location.The nurse was very friendly and talked me through all the risks that were involved with travelling to the particular country that I am going to. She was then able to advise the best course of vaccinations that were needed.Very happy with the service and will definitely use this clinic in the future.
8058	8058	Very nice and helpful nurse @ the Kings Cross branch.
8059	8059	"This was a great experience. We didn't have to wait for our appointment at all and were waved almost straight through. The advice was very helpful and the consultant was very knowledgeable. In the end we were left really satisfied with the service, would go again and would definitely recommend. Excellent work!"
8060	8060	I arrive 15 min early for my appointment and I was seen within 5 min from arriving. The nurse was really helpful and very friendly. She explained what jabs I needed and it was all over and done in 5 mins. I would recommend this clinic to anybody that needs a fast and reliable service. I visited the clinic on the 29 of October and I'm flying to the Philippines on the 2 of November. The NHS told me here was a month wait for the vaccines!! Ridiculous!! But what can I say I'm a big fan of private healthcare..
8061	8061	"We are going to Vietnam and Cambodia and needed more information about the vaccination. My partner booked appointment in Liverpool Street clinic where we have been informed about these countries and been shown the map with the diseases in the areas we are going to. My partner got the jabs at the same time. As I have been on the antibiotics the time, I have done my appointment the following week in Waterloo clinic as this is closer to my work. We like the booking system on their website - it is very easy and quick. And the appointment is on time and very quick too with the friendly and professional service. We are happy to use London Travel Clinic next time we will travel to abroad."
8062	8062	I have been to many travel clinics in London area but never saw a hassle free service.You can make online booking. You can fill questionnaire online to save you time when you reach at the clinic. It literally took me 5 to 7 minutes to get my Yellow Fever Vaccination done.Extremely pleased with their service. The nurse was very polite.
8063	8063	Went there thinking it was NHS after going on their website but cost a fortune. Wish I'd just gone to my GP.
8064	8064	"It was easy to go to the London Travel Clinic for my pre-holiday shots. They put Vietnam up on their computer, asked exactly where in Vietnam where I was going to visit and gave me the necessary vaccines. Even the malaria tablets were dispensed there and then. I was able to buy various sizes of Deet spray against mosquito's, this is a great one stop shop."
8065	8065	"Cannot recommend the London Travel Clinic enough. Very easy to book an appointment, regular reminders and friendly staff!"
8066	8066	"The nurse at the London Bridge Travel Clinic was really friendly, ran me through all of the options and didn't even laugh when I mentioned I was afraid of needles."
8067	8067	"My friend and I wanted to get a meningitis jab and didn't want to wait four weeks to get an appointment at the GP, so we chose to go the travel clinic in Waterloo instead, where were able to get an appointment on the same day that we called. Our nurse Richard was super friendly and knowledgeable and really took his time to explain everything thoroughly to us. Definitely recommendable!"
8068	8068	"I recently used the clinic to obtain travel jabs for a trip to West Africa. I found the experience very swift, professional and the nursing staff were knowledgable and balanced regarding the options. I would use the clinic again."
8069	8069	"I visited the Oxford Street Clinic two years ago, and the good service hasn't changed at all!Due to a last minute trip to Kenya I phoned the Clinic and they got me booked in straight away.I had a very busy morning that day with meetings and as a result of a chaotic traffic in the West End area, I arrived very late to my appointment. Fortunately the lovely receptionist -Mariella- was very helpful and persuade the nurse to squeeze me in as she saw how desperate I was to get my Yellow Fever jab done that day. Thank you very much for that Mariella, and i have to mention the nurse too, who was quick and efficient. I highly recommend London Travel Clinic.John"
8070	8070	"As a US citizen who needed to finish a vaccination series on an already planned holiday I worried about how I would get it done. LTC was helpful, made calls to clarify my needs and my follow up took less then five minutes. I will recommend them to anyone. Also it's way less expensive then the States."
8071	8071	"I arrived at the easy to find location at Waterloo, as I entered the receptionist asked me to wait in the foyer. After several approaches to ask if I could go to my appointment at the travel clinic, an hour after after my appointment was due I requested the receptionist check if anyone was actually in. They were. After the LTC being notified there was a queue of people waiting we could now be seen to. When I was sent up to the London Travel Clinic the staff were apologetic and processed my appointment speedily. The nurse was great and thorough. However, the wasted hour of my time sat in reception on a Saturday morning, was most frustrating. The communication and process of seeing patients at this building needs to be improved upon."
8072	8072	"I needed travel vaccinations at short notice so booked with the London travel clinic. Making the appointment was quick and easy and the ability to complete the medical questionnaire online meant that less time was needed at the clinic itself.I was seen by Katarina at the Wandsworth site. She was very friendly, efficient and knowledgable. She presented me with all the available vaccination options setting out the pros and cons of each to enable me to make an informed decision. She was also very helpful in trying to ensure I didn't waste money taking vaccines I'd already had. I'd been to Kenya fairly recently but couldn't recall what vaccines I'd had so Katarina tried to access my medical files and call my gp to clarify the position. This was all to prevent me paying ?70 for a yellow fever jab as it is not harmful to be vaccinated more than once - This was much appreciated.Overall a very pleasant experience and I would definitely use this service again."
8073	8073	"Very easy booking procedure, easily changed appointment on the day from one clinic to another and very heldful nurse. Highly recommended."
8074	8074	Super-efficient service.  No waiting and excellent communication throughout.  Highly recommend!
8075	8075	"I feel they went over and beyond, the nurse Lucy was very informative. consultation to make sure everything was in order before administering the Yellow Fever. Also lots of advice for when traveling. would highly recommend the London Travel Clinic to anyone. Service 5 Star Plus."
8076	8076	I went to the Paddington branch at for a 7.15pm appointment. I arrived 35 minutes early and was seen straight away. My jab was administered well (given I'm not great with needles) and I felt I was properly advised. I'd use this clinic again. Thanks.
8077	8077	Super helpful. Thank you
8078	8078	I was able to book an appointment within 24 hours of registering.The clinic was easy to find and I thought that the receptionist and the nurse were both very friendly and professional.  The nurse also knew that I wasn't great with needles so took extra care in delivering a virtually pain free shot.I would definitely go back there in the future and would highly recommend London Travel Clinic to anyone else who is travelling.
8079	8079	The travel nurse was extremely helpful and answered all my questions!
8080	8080	"Helpful advice on what vaccinations I would and wouldn't need for my trip to East Africa, no hard sell, & the nurse even gave me some tips for where to go whilst I'm out there!  Quick and easy - highly recommended."
8081	8081	"I needed vaccination for my trip toAfrica and came across London Travel Clinic online. They were very professional and helpful. As an adult with an aberrant fear of needles, I actually didn't feel anything until the jabs were completed. They even sat with me to go though areas I would be visiting in order to determine specific vaccinations I would need. What I found most helpful was their assistance in looking up local clinics which I could contact in case of an emergency.  I found this reassuring as it is not always obvious were to look for medical help in a foreign country. I highly recommend them!!!"
8082	8082	Tara was really nice and helpful.
8083	8083	"My experience was excellent.  Quick, clean and convenient!"
8084	8084	"The service at the Waterloo Branch of the London Travel Clinic was amazing. The receptionist and nurse were extremely helpful. We had a last minute appointment and she happily accommodated us. Thank you Waterloo Branch! Best, John M."
8085	8085	"I wasn't able to get an appointment with the travel nurse at my GP surgery in time (over a month's wait for an appointment), so booked with London Travel Clinic. It was dead easy to book an appointment, particularly as they have early morning and evening availability. The nurse I saw was confident and efficient and was able to do my injections and supply anti-malarial tablets at the same time."
8086	8086	"Can't fault the London Travel Clinic for efficiency, I saw the nurse exactly on time, got the advice I needed quickly, injections were over and done with, and all in a matter of minutes. When you don't have a huge amount of time in the day, need a short notice appointment and the GP can't accommodate you, this service is worth every penny."
8087	8087	"The receptionists were welcoming and efficient. I was seen by the nurse at the time agreed. The nurse was very nice, efficient, knowledgeable and I had my jabs (three) without almost noticing the needles. She had the knack for doing it! I will recommend your London Travel Clinic without any doubt, but keep your standards as high by being a good employer and congratulating always your staff for their good work."
8088	8088	Very professional and caring nurse advised on travel vaccinations for holiday to Africa. I'm a coward around needles and she made the whole thing bearable. Can thoroughly recommend the Liverpool Street clinic
8089	8089	"I travel a lot and have had vaccinations with my GP and other travel clinics. The nurse spent the time to consolidate my vaccine history onto one card and assessed which boosters and anti malarials I required. We then discussed additional, 'non-vaccine preventable' risks in my destination, which I had never expected! Altogether, it was an excellent, professional, non pushy and friendly service. I will return to this travel clinic for my future vaccines."
8090	8090	Unfortunately I can't remember the nurses name but he was lovely. He was very kind and informative and made the whole experience (almost - there is a sting) painless. I would highly recommend using the Travel Clinic at Wandsworth.
8091	8091	"My research fellowship to Australia hangs in the balance because of the terrible experience at this clinic. I went to their Soho branch and asked for blood tests and a dose of Diptheria, Tetanus and Pertussis. The nurse instead gave me Diptheria, Tetanus and POLIO despite my explicit instructions. As a clinician I am aware what I asked for.Subsequently it turns out they do not have Pertussis in stock and are refusing to refund me so I can get it elsewhere. The other hitch is Pertussis is only supplied as a combined vaccination with Diptheria and Tetanus so I may not be able to get another shot in time to start my fellowship as I will have to wait a few weeks to avoid toxicity.Overall nightmare experience/ especially as their blood test results take days to arrive - other clinics in London the result is ready within 4hrs.To worsen things they kept spelling my name wrong on all the receipts I was given.Attend London TRAVEL Clinic AT YOUR PERIL -"
8092	8092	"Practitioner seemed very experienced, was very helpful and provided a lot of guidance on health issues with respect to travelling through high risk countries as well as being at very high altitude"
8093	8093	"Needed some injections for a trip to South America and the nurse at the Kings Cross branch was excellent. She was very knowledgable, provided very good information and discussed the options we had. At no time did we feel under pressure to have more than we needed and the actual injections were administered in a professional way with minimal pain."
8094	8094	very happy with the service i received.  the nurse put me at ease and was very comprehensive in spelling out all the vaccination options available. will come again.
8095	8095	I got a Yellow Fever vaccination.  I rang up in the morning and got an appointment that lunchtime.  I arrived was seen straight away.  She went through where I was going and the various vaccinations I might need.Vaccination done and paid for.  In and out in less than 10 minutes.
8096	8096	"I went to the liverpool street branch on 28/08/2015 as I had to have some injections because of my new occupation. I was very nervous as I hate jabs and have actively avoided them wherever possible. To be honest, I almost didn't go to the appointment, especially as there were several pubs en route. The clinic itself was clean and tidy but not 'clinical' like a gp or dentist surgery. The reception staff were lovely and the nurse was very understanding, explained everything to me and put me at ease. I told her about my phobia and she didnt make me feel stupid or that I was making a fuss which I am extremely grateful for. When  you have a phobia you know it is irrational but can't help how you feel. I have to say it was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be and I feel much more comfortable about going back for boosters in a few weeks time. The nurse made sure I was okay afterwards and I cant thank her enough for her compassion, professionalism and kindness. This probably was not a big deal for her but for me it was one of the most scary things I have done in my life and she was brilliant. Would definately recommend and the price was very reasonable too."
8097	8097	I was very anxious before my appointment.  The Nurse was so kind and very informative.
8098	8098	"Booked appointment at very short notice, very professional and helpful staff, in and out in no time. All in all an excellent experience"
8099	8099	The clinic was very small but well organised. I only had to wait about a minute before I was seen by a very friendly and informative nurse. I would definitely recommend this clinic to anybody!
8100	8100	"It's so easy to book online, and with there being many locations to choose from there is always a time slot available to suits you.The staff are always really friendly and knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions you may have."
8101	8101	Excellent experience; efficient and organised staff.  I was seen earlier than my appointment time and the 2 jabs I received were professionally administered.  Easy online booking system definitely a plus.
8102	8102	Anna was brilliant and explained everything. I also received a warm welcome from the minute I arrived.
8103	8103	"Booked around an hour before my appointment which was perfect for me having left my injections so late before my trip.Didn't have to queue at all, went straight in for my vaccinations and took around 15 mins for the consultation and injections.Ahead of going I was worried the company would try to recommend every vaccination under the sun - I did my research and the doctor/nurse only recommended those which I needed.Very happy and would definitely go back again."
8104	8104	"Soho Square Clinic.Getting an appointment was easy, everything is arranged on-line.Once there was attended within 5 minutes of the time of my appointment.The nurse was friendly and the information she provided helpful and honest (she didn't push me to purchase things that I didn't need).I needed a few vaccines and the process was quick and almost painless.The only caveat being that some of the vaccines are not cheap at all, that was more painful than the needles.I'll definitely be back if I need to."
8105	8105	"I had a great experience with the London Travel Clinic at Liverpool st. I booked my appointment on Sunday night and had a 15 min appointment at 9.45 on Monday morning. I sat down in the waiting room at 9.44 and within a minute, my name was called and a lovely nurse came and got me. We sat down and went through where I was going and the risks. She was so friendly and nice. Then she gave me my jab which took 2 minutes and wished me on my way - I was even able to pay by debit card in her nurses room, rather than having to go back to reception! Overall it was amazingly quick, easy and would recommend it to anyone!"
8106	8106	"A quick vaccination that took 3 minutes, even though I arrived early!"
8107	8107	I couldn't get the travel vaccinations I required on the NHS for lack of time and available appointments. I was unsure about getting injections at a random building but the clinic was clean and everyone I met was friendly.  I didn't feel pressured into getting injections that were not required 'just in case' and everything was done calmly and efficiently.If I was unable to get vaccinations on the NHS for whatever reason again I would have no worries about going back to this clinic.
8108	8108	"I was in a panic because I had forgotten to organise my jabs.  My doctor was unable to help at short notice.  I managed to book an appointment with the London Travel Clinic and was seen on the same day.  The nurse put me at ease.  She was well informed, gave advice and thoroughly explained the vaccines I would require.I was very pleased with the entire service, right from booking the appointment.  I would not hesitate to use them again and have recommended the clinic to my friends."
8109	8109	"I was recommended by an NHS nurse that I get the Japanese Encephalitis vaccination for my travels to Asia when I was picking up my malaria pill prescription. At this point, I only had 21 days before flying so was told I would need an accelerated dose of three injections, rather than the two injections taken on day 1 and 28. I booked an appointment at London Travel Clinic in Liverpool Street for later that day. I explained the situation to the nurse and asked if it was possible to do within 21 days. She replied with ""Yes, I'll give you one dose now and another in 28 days."" As she clearly had not listened to anything that I had said, I repeated that I would not be in the country in 28 days. She replied with that was fine and to come back as soon as possible for the second dose. I told her that surely it would be best to come as late as possible to give the antibodies a chance to work. She then agreed with me. By this point she had already prepped the needle and was moving towards my arm and I was seriously questioning whether I should let her inject me as I felt she wasn't listening and didn't seem to know what she was talking about. I stopped her from injecting me and asked if there were any dangers of receiving the injection a week before it was recommended. She advised that there were no dangers, it just would be around 80% effective. I figured (regrettably) that it would be better to at least have that degree of protection and went ahead with the injection as I was also aware that I did not have time to get it elsewhere. I was left feeling very concerned about the experience and thoroughly researched whether it would be okay to have the second injection so much earlier. I could not find anything to suggest it was okay to have it earlier than day 24. I returned to see an NHS nurse who recommended that I didn't have it on day 21 and try and get it in Asia on day 28. The country I was travelling to did not stock the same vaccination so I was unable to have it. I then called the main London Travel Clinic number and was able to speak to a very helpful, lovely nurse who confirmed that I should not have the second injection any sooner than 24 days and that I should not have been given the first injection. For this reason, I am sure other London Travel Clinics do contain great staff but avoid the Liverpool Street branch. I felt like the nurse who saw me was just interested in getting money out of me and although it is my fault that I did not allow the 28 days, I expect from a health professional to have a duty of care in regards to my health and to adequately inform me if a complete service is not possible. I paid ?90 for an injection that was totally ineffective and I will not be using the service again."
8110	8110	"I have never travelled before, so I had no clue of vaccination risks and procedures. The information I was given was poor. The nurse did not answer my doubts about vaccination timings, and didn't explain me pros and cons of getting or not some optional vaccinations. She simply suggested to check their website, and that the choice 'was up to me'. Pretty obvious, but that's not professional advice, it's just a fact I am well aware of myself. Also, pretty hard to find location (behind Liverpool Street station), very poor Reception in the building and no adequate costumer service for the hefty rates of their services. I found much better service elsewhere."
8111	8111	"Dear Sir/MadamThank you for giving me the chance for a review!I found this travel clinic a couple of weeks ago to be able to receive Hepatitis B vaccinations due to my career (dentistry). I must tell you I have been pleased with the service of your clinic, thanks to  the nurses` polite and proactive, well-organized and rapid work I could achieve my aims faster than at the GP surgery."
8112	8112	"Preparing for a trip to Thailand, my wife and I booked a same-day appointment. The nurse told us about all the diseases present in the area and what vaccines were recommended. She didn't pressure us to buy anything we didn't need, and even took the time to tell us how to avoid diseases that cannot be vaccinated against."
8113	8113	"I visited London Travel Clinic before travelling to the Philippines at short notice. I had a short, friendly and focussed consultation in which we determined what I didn't need (because I'm not going to rural areas) and what I did. The jabs were administered quickly and painlessly, along with sensible advice on how to minimise health risks in an unfamiliar environment."
8114	8114	Able to get suitable appointment at a clinic near work morning after looking on line. Was impressed that the nurse did not try to sell any vaccinations or medications that were not essential or that I agreed may be a good idea.  Really friendly place and very quick and pleasant experience. Will definitely use again
8115	8115	"Clinic is in a very nice building about 2 minutes walk from Liverpool street. I cut my finger badly and needed a Tetanus booster within 48 hours. Staff are very kind. I didn't have to wait at all, simply filled out a form, and got a quick tetanus shot. Beds are available if needed. Costs 30 pounds. As an American living in London abroad, this was as quick and easy as it got. Can even make your appt. online."
8116	8116	"Professional and personal. I have a fear of needles, had no idea what to expect, but the consultant took the time to discuss the options fully and was extremely understanding of my fear. The jab was painless and quick, and the appointment was last minute, so very efficient. Big thank you. I'll be back for more soon!"
8117	8117	"A simple to arrange and well manged appointment system backed up with knowledgeable, professional and courteous staff."
8118	8118	"Incredibly helpful consultant, she talked me through everything clearly and provided me with an instant solution. Very impressed and I would thoroughly recommend."
8119	8119	"I hate needles but the doctor put me at ease, was informative and friendly. The jab I received (yellow fever) was carried out in such a quick, smooth, very practised manner I didn't actually feel anything and it was over before I realised it. V professional. I highly recommend."
8120	8120	"I was literally in and out in 15 minutes. I had loads of questions, they were all answered plus given two jabs for travelling. Would highly recommend."
8121	8121	Fantastic lovely staff and great service would 100% recommend to others.Such simplicity.
8122	8122	"Went straight in exactly at the allotted time, had a through consultation with the nurse covering aspects as well beyond vaccination.Excellent service."
8123	8123	"I was able to make a same day appointment at a convenient location for me in Paddington. I arrived and the nurse talked me through what jabs she recommended, and explained what I would need to do while abroad if I didn't opt for the jabs that she suggested. Very clean and professional environment, and friendly nurse, which helps to put you at ease (plus done very quickly, almost painlessly!). The injections were quite expensive, but this was ok for me as I had left it to last minute and there were no available appointments at my GP practice.I highly recommend the London Travel Clinic."
8124	8124	Really friendly and thorough answered all my questions and was very efficient.
8125	8125	"I'm generally a poor traveller (I get a nosebleed at Calais) and hate injections so the prospect of my ""big birthday"" motor cycle trip to South America (needing several doses of antibiotics) filled me with dread but Lucy was charming, entertaining and genuinely interesting today about her own travels such that I really didn't feel a thing!Well done; a great service with a smile!"
8126	8126	I attended the Soho Clinic last minute for an evening appointment and found the staff on hand very professional and friendly. Great advice from the travel nurse and was spared the unnecessary expense of buying an additional  vaccination I didn't need. Thanks for all your help and I will be coming back again.
8127	8127	"I suspect my experience is not that of others but it was very poor. The nurse twice misread my vaccination record so was initially going to administer me a vaccination I didn't need until I corrected her. Then, when she said I was all clear, I pointed out that I did actually still need one vaccination which had run out, and she subsequently corrected herself to agree with. Then, when cutting out the malaria pills from a pre-packed box of 12, she quite literally was unable to count to 6. She initially cut them and said that it was the right number, until I pointed it was 2 short. Then she redid it, but was 4 short! Finally, I manually pointed out where she had to cut in order to get the right amount...By this point, I frankly didn't trust her ability to perform a vaccination correctly so bought my malaria pills and left. When I explained my lack of trust, she was unable to explain why she'd been incapable of counting the pills out.I am still very confused by the whole experience. In the long run, it'll have no impact for me but it is concerning that she would have twice mis-administered vaccinations in the space of a few minutes as this could have serious consequences if someone weren't paying as much attention as I was. Through lack of other choice at short notice, I will be returning to a different branch of London Travel Clinic this week to get my final jab done by a different nurse. On a more positive note, the online booking system was very easy and there was lots of availability."
8128	8128	"System worked well, booked appointment, no wasted waiting time, just 1 innoculation jab but administered professionally and as painlessly! as possible. A good way to get this job (part 3 of 3 course jab programme) done."
8129	8129	Excellent professional same day service. Good prices too. Also got some travel tips from a friendly travel nurse. Will surely use again.
8130	8130	It is so easy to book online and get same day appointments! The staff are friendly and efficient and know their area of practice! Recommended!
8131	8131	"I have received many jabs for an upcoming trip in Asia. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. It was nice to have the convenience to schedule my appointments at different locations depending on my work schedule that week. As someone who doesn't like needles I was very comfortable, it was over quickly and I would definitely go back..."
8132	8132	"I had an appointment at the Soho Square branch. The nurse was knowledgable, informative and friendly.  I was nervous about vaccinations and she reassured me and put my mind at ease.  I found the whole service very efficient (much more than my GP surgery!) and I liked the simplicity of the online booking system. All in all, a great service."
8133	8133	Got an appointment the same afternoon right opposite Waterloo Station. The nurse was lovely and really knew her stuff. Sooooooo much better than my GP!!!
8134	8134	"Reliable and helpful, very friendly, good advice and convenient to access."
