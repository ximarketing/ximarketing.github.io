As part of the course requirement, each group is going to choose and present an academic research on digital marketing. The papers cover various topics such as online review, word-of-mouth, digital advertising and mobile marketing. The purpose of this paper presentation is to help you gain an understanding of how leading digital marketing experts worldwide are using the latest technologies to address contemporary issues.       

The paper presentation contributes 10% of your final grade. You are going to make the presentation in one of the classes. It should be a brief one, taking around 12 minutes.     

**What should be presented?**  
1.	Motivation. Why did the authors work on this study? What is its topic? Is it an important topic?    
2.	Data. Which dataset did the authors use for the study (e.g., scraped online datasets? Publicly-available datasets? Company datasets? Field experiments data?)        
3.	Results. What are the findings of this study? If there are many findings, focus on the most important ones. No need to cover every single result.    
4.	Implications. What can firms/consumers/platforms/policymakers/researchers learn from the study? For example, you may suggest that firms can take certain measures to improve their profits.        

**What should NOT be presented?**  
1.	Data analysis. Well, the data analysis in these papers is very complex and you cannot present in a few minutes. So, we just need to understand the topic and results; no need to present the detailed data analysis.     
2.	Literature Review/Identification/Robustness checks. Many papers have these sections. No need to cover them.     
3.	Any other issues not explicitly mentioned above.     

**What should be submitted?**    
Only your presentation slides (approximately 8-10 pages). No reports needed.
