**Information for the research project**    

The research project is a group project that accounts for 25% of your final grade. You are going to give a presentation of your research project in the end of the class. Below is some useful information on the project. If you have any further questions, please contact the course instructor.    

**What should we do?**    

In short, you are going to choose a company or brand, and analyse the company’s (brand’s) digital marketing strategy using the concepts and tools we learned in the class. There are not restrictions on the choice of the company, just note one thing: This company should be socially active --- at least it should have its own official websites as well social media accounts (e.g., FB, Instagram, Twitter).    

**What should be included in the project?**    

You are recommended to apply digital marketing concepts to address the following issues in the project:    

1.  Company website. How can you improve the company’s website? To address this issue, you can refer to our lecture on “search engine optimization”, which speaks to the design of a successful website that improves your page rank. In addition, you may also provide recommendations on the mobile website.
