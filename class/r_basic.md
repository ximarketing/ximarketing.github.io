This file provides you with a list of very basic R operations.



Simple algebra calculations:

```r
x = 100
y = 150
print(x)
print(y)
z1 = x * y
z2 = x / y
z3 = x + y
z4 = x - y
z5 = x^2
print(c(z1,z2,z3,z4,z5))    
```


Basic logical operations: 

```r
a = 100
b = 100 
c = 100.5
c1 <- (a == b)  # compare if a is equal to b
print(c1)
c2 <- (a < 90) # compare if a is smaller than 90
print(c2)
c3 <- (c >= 100) # compare if c is greater than or equal to 100
print(c3)
```

Basic String Operations
```r
a = "Big"
b = "Data"
c = "Marketing"
d = 100
s1 = paste0(a, b) 
s2 = paste(a, b, c) 
print(s1)
print(s2)
s4 = toString(d)
print(d)
print(s4)
```

Hello

    a = 100
    b = 120
