This file provides you with a list of very basic R operations.



Simple Algebra Calculations:

     

     x = 100
     y = 150
     print(x)
     print(y)
     z1 = x * y
     z2 = x / y
     z3 = x + y
     z4 = x - y
     z5 = x^2
     print(c(z1,z2,z3,z4,z5))    


More complex ones:
```r
hello
```
More complex ones:
```{r}
a=1+1
b<-a
print(b)
```
